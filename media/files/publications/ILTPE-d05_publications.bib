  Abstract                 = {The temperature behavior of the crystal structure as well as dielectric and magnetic properties of the perovskite bismuth chromate ceramics with the 10 mol \% Cr3+-to-Sc3+ substitution were studied and compared with those of the unmodified compound. Using a high-pressure synthesis, BiCrO3 and BiCr0.9Sc0.1O3 were obtained as metastable perovskite phases which are monoclinic C2/c with the √6ap × √2ap × √6ap superstructure (where ap is the primitive perovskite unit-cell parameter) under ambient conditions. At room temperature, the unit cell volume of BiCr0.9Sc0.1O3 is ∼1.3\% larger than that of BiCrO3. Both perovskites undergo a reversible structural transition into a nonpolar GdFeO3-type phase (orthorhombic Pnma, √2ap × 2ap × √2ap) in the temperature ranges of 410–420 K (BiCrO3) and 470–520 K (BiCr0.9Sc0.1O3) with a relative jump of the primitive perovskite unit cell volume of about −1.6 and −2.0\%, respectively. Temperature dependences of the complex dielectric permittivity demonstrate anomalies in the phase transition ranges. The Pnma-to-C2/c crossover in BiCrO3 is accompanied by a decrease in the direct current (dc) conductivity, while in BiCr0.9Sc0.1O3 the conductivity increases. The onset of an antiferromagnetic order in BiCr0.9Sc0.1O3 is observed at the Néel temperature (TN) of about 85 K as compared with TN = 110 K in BiCrO3. In contrast to BiCrO3, which exhibits a spin reorientation at Tsr ∼ 72 K, no such a transition occurs in BiCr0.9Sc0.1O3.},

  Abstract                 = {The crystal structure, magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature chi(T) in the range 5-400 K, and the hydrostatic pressure effect on chi at fixed temperaturesT = 78, 150, and 300 K, were studied in perovskite-like compounds La1-xPrxCoO3(x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3). The obtained experimental data were analyzed using a two-level model with an energy gap Delta between the ground and excited states of the system that correspond to the spin valuesS = 0 and 1 for Co(3+)ions. In this model, the magnetism of Co(3+)ions, which determines the features of the
 chi (T) dependence, is ensured by the temperature-induced change in the population of the excited state. The anomalously large magnitude of the observed pressure effect is associated with the high sensitivity of Delta to changes in the lattice volume, under the influence of both hydrostatic and chemical pressures, when La is replaced by the smaller Pr ion in the considered system. Theoretical calculations of the electronic structure for the boundary compounds LaCoO(3)and PrCoO(3)confirm the significant increase in the excitation energy Delta with a decrease in the lattice volume, and also support the scenario of a spin crossover between the states of cobalt ions with low and intermediate spin values.},

The ab-initio simulation confirmed (1) benefits in binding energy and enthalpy of formation if stoichiometry of the solid solution is near MgB1.75O0.25; (2) energetic advantage in case if impurity oxygen present only in each second boron plane of MgB2 cell while the first boron plane of the same cell stays pristine and location of substituted oxygen atoms in the nearby positions. Besides, the results of ab-initio modeling allow explanation of the tendency towards segregation of O-impurity in MgB2 structure during synthesis or sintering, and formation of Mg-B-O inclusions or nanolayers (with MgO type of structure) which effect pinning. Calculated transition temperatures, Tc, for MgB1.75O0.25 occurred to be 23.3 K, while for MgB2 it was 21.13 K only. Experimental Tc of the bulk materials was 35.7-38.2 K.},

  Abstract                 = {Below the Néel temperature, TN∼220 K, at least two nano-scale antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases coexist in the polar polymorph of the BiFe0.5Sc0.5O3 perovskite; one of these phases is a weak ferromagnetic. Non-uniform structure distortions induced by high-pressure synthesis lead to competing AFM orders and a nano-scale spontaneous magnetic phase separated state of the compound. Interface exchange coupling between the AFM domains and the weak ferromagnetic domains causes unidirectional anisotropy of magnetization, resulting in the exchange bias (EB) effect. The EB field, HEB , and the coercive field strongly depend on temperature and the strength of the cooling magnetic field. HEB increases with an increase in the cooling magnetic field and reaches a maximum value of about 1 kOe at 5 K. The exchange field vanishes above TN with the disappearance of long-range magnetic ordering. The effect is promising for applications in electronics as it is large enough and as it is tunable by temperature and the magnetic field applied during cooling.},

It was revealed that the Faraday rotation φ varies with thickness of the Cu layers dCu. This φ(dCu) dependence consists of the monotonic component, namely a gradual rise of the angle with increase of dCu, and the non-monotonic one represented by two minima. The monotonic changes of the Faraday rotation were satisfactory described in frames of the effective medium method. Two minima are explained with the Co layer’s fragmentation due to influence of size electron quantization in the Cu layers on formation of Co clusters during deposition of the films.},

The field-induced phase transition causes a discontinuous temperature decrease, indicating a larger magnetic entropy above the transition. Furthermore, we find pronounced anomalies in the acoustic properties, which signals strong spin-lattice interactions. A further anomaly observed at fields slightly above the transition is likely related to the formation of magnetic domains. A model based on the exchange-striction coupling mechanism well reproduces the strong renormalization of the acoustic properties.},

The specific dependence χ(T) observed in LaCoO3 and the anomalously large pressure effect (dlnχ/dP ∼ -100 Mbar-1 for T = 78 K) are analyzed in the framework of a two-level model with energy levels difference Δ. The ground state of the system is assumed to be nonmagnetic with the zero spin of Co3+ ions, and magnetism at a finite temperature is determined by the excited magnetic spin state. The results of the analysis, supplemented by theoretical calculations of the electronic structure of LaCoO3, indicate a significant increase in Δ with a decrease in the unit cell volume under the hydrostatic pressure. In the series of RCoO3 (R = Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu) compounds, the volume of crystal cell decreases monotonically due to a decrease in the radius of R3+ ions. This leads to an increase in the relative energy Δ of the excited state (the chemical pressure effect), which manifests itself in a decrease in the contribution of cobalt ions to the magnetic susceptibility at a fixed temperature, and also in a decrease in the hydrostatic pressure effect on the susceptibility of RCoO3 compounds, which we have observed at T = 300 K.},

Its activation energy Q ≈ 1.1 meV is comparable with the antiferromagnetic interaction energy in this compound. The temperature–time dependence of the relaxation rate at the second stage is described by a power law. The relaxation slows down as the temperature approaches the critical value, which may be associated with the formation of a cluster structure in the studied compound under these conditions.},

Both polymorphs show a weak ferromagnetic component below the Néel temperature, TN ~220 K. A wide cusp-like anomaly of the temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility was revealed below 200 K. The anomaly is dependent on the magnetic field applied and can be associated with the glassy magnetic behavior of the compound. The best fit of the initial magnetization curves taken at each temperature can be obtained as a sum of two contributions, namely the nonlinear in field and the linear one. The nonlinear contribution appeared to be temperature and magnetic field dependent, which is in a good agreement with the magnetization experimentally obtained as a function of temperature in different magnetic fields applied. Increase of external magnetic field leads to a decrease of the nonlinear contribution to the total magnetic moment.},

It is shown that for x ∼ 0.2 systems undergo a transition from an antiferromagnetic state (x=0) to a ferromagnetic state. In the case of the R=La series a structural transformation from theO?-orthorhombic phase (x=0) to theO-orthorhombic one occurs, which is due to orbital disordering. At x.0.6 cluster spin glass like phases arise due to the competition between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions, as well as due to the strong diamagnetic dilution. In case of the R=Pr series the structural transition into theO-orthorhombic phase was not observed under (Sr, Sb) codoping. As the ionic radius of the rare-earth ion decreases in the series R0.7 Sr0.3 Mn0.85 Sb0.15O3 the crystal structure distortion increases and the ferromagnetic state (R=La, Pr, Nd) is gradually transformed into a spin glass like state (R=Sm, Eu). The ferromagnetic compounds are insulators and exhibit a large magnitude of the magnetoresistance apparently associated with very small amount ofMn4+ ions.

The pressure dependence of magnetic susceptibility χ of LaCoO3 is obtained by precise measurements of χ as a function of the hydrostatic pressure P up to 2 kbar in the temperature range from 78 K to 300 K. A pronounced magnitude of the pressure effect is found to be negative in sign and strongly temperature dependent. The obtained experimental data are analysed by using a two-level model and DFT+U calculations of the electronic structure of LaCoO3. In particular, the fixed spin moment method was employed to obtain a volume dependence of the total energy difference Δ between the low spin and the intermediate spin states of LaCoO3. Analysis of the obtained experimental χ(P) dependence within the two-level model, as well as our DFT+U calculations, have revealed the anomalous large decrease in the energy difference Δ with increasing of the unit cell volume. This effect, taking into account a thermal expansion, can be responsible for the temperatures dependence of Δ, predicting its vanishing near room temperature.},

This paper describes the design of a gradiometer made with a carbon-fiber reinforced composite material for magnetic cardiography measurements. The thermal coefficient of linear expansion (TCLE) of the carbon fiber composite can be precisely adjusted to match that of the superconducting detector coil wire. This is achieved thanks to the difference in the TCLE of carbon fibers in the longitudinal and transverse directions and is realized by varying the laying directions of the fiber in the composite. The data of magnetic susceptibility measurements on carbon fiber composite are reported, showing the magnetic susceptibility about six times smaller than that of graphite. The presented gradiometer design provides a high degree of balancing and is patented along side other specific techniques.},

Magnetic properties were studied using a SQUID magnetometer technique over the temperature range of 5−300 K in magnetic fields up to H=10 kOe. The field dependent magnetization M(H) was measured in magnetic fields up to 50 kOe at different temperatures up to 230 K after zero-field cooling procedure. A long-range magnetic ordering of the AFM type with a weak FM contribution occurs below the Néel temperature TN ~237 K. Magnetic hysteresis loops taken below TN show a huge coercive field up to Hc ~10 kOe. A strong effect of magnetic field on the magnetic properties of the compound has been found. Derivative of the initial magnetization curves demonstrates a temperature-dependent anomaly in fields of H=15−25 kOe. Besides, an anomaly of the temperature dependent zero-field cooled magnetization measured in magnetic fields of 6−7 kOe has been found. Origin of both anomalies is associated with inhomogeneous magnetic state of the compound. The heat capacity has been measured from 2 K up to room temperature and a significant contribution from the magnon excitations at low temperatures has been detected. From the low-temperature heat capacity, an anisotropy gap of the magnon modes of the order 3.7 meV and Debye temperature TD=189 K have been determined.},

  Abstract                 = {New experimental results on the pressure dependence of magnetic susceptibility χ of SmS in semiconducting phase are obtained with precise measurements of χ as a function of the hydrostatic pressure P up to 2 kbar at liquid nitrogen and room temperatures. A pronounced magnitude of the pressure effect is found to be positive in sign and strongly temperature dependent: the pressure derivatives of χ, d lnχ/dP, are 6.3 ± 0.5 and 14.2 ± 1 Mbar−1 at 300 and 78 K, respectively. The experimental results are supplemented by theoretical calculations of the volume dependent electronic structure of SmS and orbital magnetism of the band electronic states χVV(band). It was found that χVV(band) value appeared to be strongly dependent on pressure, determining the main mechanism of the observed puzzling pressure effects in semiconducting SmS compound.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes the established correlations between the characteristics of MgB2-based superconducting materials and their structural features, in particular the oxygen distribution and content. As indicated by SEM and Auger analysis, a sizeable amount of oxygen is usually present in superconducting MgB2 -based materials (bulks, thin films, and wires). The matrix phase of bulk MgB2 contains rather small amounts of oxygen, but contains a high amount of dispersed inclusions or areas with compositions close to MgBO. X-ray phase analysis with Rietveld refinement (using the FullProf Suite program package) of several highly dense MgB2 -based bulk samples (with high critical current densities) showed that the superconducting phase had a composition within the range MgB1.68O0.26 and MgB1.74O0.32 instead of pure MgB2. Besides, a small amount of a phase with MgO structure was observed in the materials by X-rays as well. The calculation of the enthalpy of formation confirms the possibility of oxygen solubility in MgB2 and shows that the formation of MgB1.75B0.25 is most favorable. The results of ab initio calculations of the electronic structure and stability of the MgB2 compounds with partial oxygen substitution for boron show that it is energetically preferable for oxygen atoms to replace boron pairwise.},

  Abstract                 = {The comparison of nano-crystalline MgB2 oxygen-containing thin film (140 nm) and highly dense bulk materials showed that the critical current density, Jc, depends on the distribution of Mg-B-O nano-scale inhomogeneities. It has been shown that MgB2 bulks with high Jc in low (∼106 A/cm2 in 0-1 T at 10 K) and medium magnetic fields contain MgB0.6-0.8O0.8-0.9 nano-inclusions, where δTc or a combined δTc (dominant) / δl pinning mechanism prevails, while in bulk MgB2 with high Jc in high magnetic fields (Birr(18.5 K) = 15 T, Bc2(0 K) = 42.1 T) MgB1.2-2.7O1.8-2.5 nano-layers are present and δl pinning prevails. The structure of oxygen-containing films with high Jc in low and high magnetic fields (Jc (0 Т) = 1.8 × 107 А/сm2 and Jc (5 Т) = 2 × 106 А/сm2 at 10 К) contains very fine oxygen-enriched Mg-B-O inhomogeneities and δl pinning is realized. The results of DOS calculations in MgB2-xOx cells for x = 0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1 demonstrate that all compounds are conductors with metal-like behaviour. In the case of ordered oxygen substitution for boron the binding energy, Eb, does not increase sufficiently as compared with that for MgB2, while when oxygen atoms form zigzag chains the calculated Eb is even lower (Eb = −1.15712 Ry).},

  Abstract                 = {An x-ray analysis of MgB2-based materials shows that they contain MgB2 and MgO phases. According to a quantitative Auger analysis (taken after removing the oxidized surface layer by Ar ion etching in the microscope chamber) the MgB2 phase contains some amount of oxygen that approximately corresponds to the composition MgB2.2-1.7O0.4-0.6. Rietveld refinement of the MgB2 phase, based on EDX data with varying B/O content, leads to the composition MgB1.68-1.8O0.2-0.32. Ab-initio modelling of boron substitution by oxygen in MgB2 (ΔH f = -150.6 meV/atom) shows that this is energetically favourable up to the composition MgB1.75O0.25 (ΔH f = -191.4 meV/atom). In contrast to carbon substitution, where very small levels of doping can dramatically affect the superconducting characteristics of the material with concomitant changes in the electron density, oxygen substitution results in very little change in the superconducting properties of MgB2. The formation of vacancies at the Mg site of both MgB2 and substituted MgB1.75O0.25 was modelled as well, but has shown that such processes are energetically disadvantageous (ΔHf of Mg0.875B2 and Mg0.75B1.75O0.25 are equal to -45.5 and -93.5 meV/atom, respectively).},

Structural data testify a partial order of the Ni and Mn ions in all the compounds in spite of chemical substitution of the La3+ ions by Sr2+ ones and an increase of the oxidation state of the Ni ions from 2+ towards to 3+ one. Magnetic structure of the compounds changes from ferromagnetic one (specific for the compound with x=0) to antiferromagnetic (compounds with x ≥ 0.1) while the temperature of a transition into paramagnetic state remains about 270K for all the samples. Magnetoresistance gradually decreases with temperature increase and strontium content. The results are discussed assuming nearly equal ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic components of the superexchange interaction Ni2+-O-Mn4+ while the interaction between Ni3+ and Mn4 ions is considered to be strongly antiferromagnetic.},

  Abstract                 = {We perform analytical and numerical analysis of the electronic and phonon spectrum evolution of graphene during formation of a boundary with a "zigzag" chirality. It is determined, that the excited gap wave has a relativistic dispersion near the Fermi level that propagates along the boundary and decays with distance from it. Both properties and formation of the wave is considered. It is shown that the wave propagation occurs only along the atoms of the sub-lattice, which contains atoms with bonds broken during the boundary formation. The gap wave forms narrow resonance peaks in the local density of states of the sublattice atoms. It is shown, that the boundary formation on a graphene layer with this chirality similarly affects the phonon modes polarized normal to the layer, forming narrow maxima with frequencies nearing that of the quasiflexural phonons with the quasiwave vector at the K-point of the first Brillouin zone. This way, the formation of the "zigzag"-boundary increases both the number of charge carriers as well as the number of phonons with a large group velocity that can cause a large contribution to the electron-phonon interactions.},

  Abstract                 = {The influence of an external magnetic field on the Jahn-Teller phase transition at Tc ≈ 14 K was studied in a KDy(MoO4)2 single crystal. At temperatures below Tc a significant change in the velocity and attenuation of the acoustic modes of the crystal was observed for the magnetic field oriented along the [110] direction. This behavior of the elastic characteristics occurs due to the destruction of the antiferrodistortive ordering, which is, in turn, coupled with the ordering of the quadrupole orbital moments, characteristic for an "orbital nematic." The low-temperature region of the H-T phase diagram for this direction of the field was reconstructed. It was found that the magnetic field dependence of the critical temperature is nonmonotonic, i.e., the phase transition has the reentrant character. Theoretical description of the observed anomalies of the temperature and magnetic field behavior of the acoustic characteristics was given.},

The temperature and field dependences of the magnetic moment of single crystal samples are studied in detail for temperatures of 2-350 K in different fields up to 5 T along the c-axis. The field dependence of the observed singular temperature points, such as those for magnetic ordering, magnetic vitrification, and magnetic phase separation, is recovered. The magnetic field behavior of several of the singular points is found to be interrelated. These results are fully consistent with models of magnetic phase separation that predict the formation of self-localized states such as nanoscale ferromagnetic droplets in a bulk antiferromagnetic matrix.},

The existence of a previously observed magnetopiezoelectric effect in samarium ferroborate is confirmed. This effect consists in indirect renormalization of the piezoelectric modulus as a result of the combined action of the magnetoelectric and magnetoelastic mechanisms. The manifestation of a new type of phenomena-direct renormalization of the piezoelectric interaction in a magnetically ordered phase-is observed. The ratio of the contributions of the rare-earth and iron systems to the magnetoelectric interaction is estimated. It is shown that the latter plays a ballast role, impeding orientation fluctuations of the magnetic structure as a whole. The boundaries of existence of the helicoidal phase on the H-T plane are determined. The phenomenological interpretation of the studied effects is given.},

The exchange phase process, when the amount of the charge ordered phase increases under cooling, while the amount of the charge disordered phase decreases is the most intense between ∼220 K and 180 K. At low temperatures, T&lt;160 K, the charge ordered to the charge disordered phase ratio is about 4:1, which is in excellent agreement with previous neutron diffraction data. Both a sharp decrease of the magnetic susceptibility and a huge resistivity increase are evident of the weakening of ferromagnetic correlations and suppression of the double exchange interaction across the charge ordering due to the localization of the charge carriers.},

  Abstract                 = {The relevant pinning centers of Abrikosov vortices in MgB2-based materials are oxygen-enriched Mg-B-O inclusions or nanolayers and inclusions of MgBx (x&gt;4) phases. The high critical current densities, j c, of 106 and 103A/cm2 at 1 and 8.5 T, respectively, at 20 K can be achieved in polycrystalline materials (prepared at 2 GPa) containing a large amount of admixed oxygen. Besides, oxygen can be incorporated into the MgB2 structure in small amounts (MgB1.5O0.5), which is supported by Auger studies and calculations of the DOS and the binding energy. The j c of melt textured YBa2Cu3O7-δ (or Y123)-based superconductors (MT-YBaCuO) depends not only on the perfectness of texture and the amount of oxygen in the Y123 structure, but also on the density of twins and micro-cracks formed during the oxygenation (due to shrinking of the c-lattice parameter). The density of twins and microcracks increases with the reduction of the distance between Y2BaCuO5 (Y211) inclusions in Y123. At 77 K jc=8•104 A/cm2 in self-field and jc=103 A/cm2 at 10 T were found in materials oxygenated at 16 MPa for 3 days with a density of twins of 2235 per μm (thickness of the lamellae: 45-30 nm) and a density of micro-cracks of 200280 per mm. Pinning can occur at the points of intersection between the Y123 twin planes and the Y211 inclusions. MTYBaCuO at 77 K can trap 1.4 T (38×38×17 mm, oxygenated at 0.1 MPa for 20 days) and 0.8 T (16 mm in diameter and 10 mm thick with 0.45 mm holes oxygenated at 10 MPa for 53 h). The sensitivity of MgB2 to magnetic field variations (flux jumps) complicates estimates of the trapped field. At 20 K 1.8 T was found for a block of 30 mm in diameter and a thickness of 7.5 mm and 1.5 T (if the magnetic field was increased at a rate of 0.1 T) for a ring with dimensions 24×18 mm and a thickness of 8 mm.},

  Abstract                 = {The paper presents an analysis of the properties of bulk superconducting magnesium diboride-based materials obtained by heating at high quasi-hydrostatic pressures (1-2 GPa), hot pressing (30 MPa), spark plasma sintering (16-96 MPa) and loose powder sintering. It is shown that the optimization of impurity distribution in MgB2 can be achieved by varying the synthesis conditions and introducing dopants. In particular, polycrystalline MgB2 materials synthesized at 2 GPa and containing a high amount of impurity oxygen demonstrates high critical current densities (106 and 103 A/cm2 at 20 K in magnetic fields of 1 and 8.5 T, respectively). It is found that the oxygen impurities are mainly localized in nanolayers or nanoinclusions, homogeneously distributed in the matrix. They act as pinning centers, while the MgB2 matrix also contains small amounts of dissolved oxygen. Impurity or intentionally added carbon entering the magnesium diboride structure leads to an increase in the critical magnetic fields up to Bc2 (22 K) = 15 T and Birr (18.5 K) = 15 T. The results of ab initio calculations of the electronic structure and stability of the magnesium diboride compounds with partial oxygen or carbon substitution for boron show that it is energetically favorable for carbon to distribute homogeneously in MgB2 structure, while oxygen atoms replace boron pairwise in neighboring positions or form zigzag chains.},

  Abstract                 = {This is a study of the crystalline structure and magnetic properties of the multiferroics Bi1-xCaxFe1-xMexO3 (Me=Mn, Ti). It is shown that Mn and Ti are in a quadrivalent state and the oxygen stoichiometry is conserved. The Me=Mn series undergoes a conversion at x=0.19 from a polar rhombohedral phase (R3c) to a nonpolar orthorhombic phase (Pnma). A similar transition in the Me=Ti series was observed at x=0.25. In both series, the polar phase (x≥0.1) is weakly ferromagnetic. The spontaneous magnetization of the titanium series, however, exceeds that of the manganese series by more than a factor of three, despite the fact that Ti4+ is a diamagnetic ion. The residual magnetization of the titanium series decreases with rising temperature, while that of the manganese series increases anomalously within the interval 0.1≤x≤0.22. This behavior of the magnetic properties of the manganese series is explained by the extremely high sensitivity of the magnetic anisotropy to changes in the parameters of the crystal lattice, which leads to spin reversal.},

The Raman spectra measurements at room temperature revealed that main Raman modes, which are associated with the bipyramid FeO5, octahedra Fe(4)O6 and Fe(5)O6 as well with mixed octahedral vibration all with A1 g symmetry, shift monotonously to higher wave numbers. In the low-frequency region (&lt;10 kHz), permittivity rapidly decreases with increasing frequency, exhibiting a typical characteristic of Maxwell-Wagner type relaxation. The relaxation peak in dielectric losses centred on 100 kHz can be attributed to ionic relaxation processes caused by multiple valence states of iron ion (Fe2+ and Fe3+). M-type hexaferrite SrCo2Ti2Fe8O19 orders magnetically at 768 K and undergoes order-to-order magnetic phase transition at 380 K. Magnetic properties are almost isotropic around room temperatures with very low hysteresis having coercive field with induction lower than 3×10−3 T and with remnant magnetization lower than 0.17 μB/f.u. for magnetic fields applied along main crystallographic directions.},

  Abstract                 = {This study is focused on obtaining large CeAlO3 single crystals. Using Czochralski and Edge-Defined Film Fed Growth techniques, crystals of length up to 130 mm were obtained. The crystals belong to the tetragonal low temperature modification of CeAlO3, space group P4/mmm, a=3.7669 Å, c=3.7967 Å. Density and crystallographic parameters as well as some optical, luminescence and magnetic properties of CeAlO3 were studied. The crystals demonstrate rather bright luminescence under UV-excitation, while no luminescence has been registered under X-rays. Ceramic and single crystalline CeAlO3 samples demonstrate p-type conductivity and promising paramagnetic properties.},

The minimum of the temperature-dependent sound velocity v(T) and corresponding maximum of the decrement δ(T) were found in the vicinity of the structural phase transition R 3 → I m m a at Ts ∼ 200 K. Large alterations of v and δ indicate a structural phase transition of the soft mode type. A high sensitivity of dc magnetization to a low uniaxial pressure caused by the softening was found in the Ts region. A negative value of the linear thermal expansion coefficient along one of the crystallographic axis was found in the Imma phase near Ts. The proposed microscopic mechanism explains the appearance of the soft mode in the vicinity of the structural phase transition temperature associated with the displacement of the manganese atom from the center of the oxygen octahedron.},

A contribution to the total magnetization of the compounds due to the ferromagnetic phase has been evaluated. It has been found that yttrium doping leads to the growth of the ferromagnetic phase fraction. The ferromagnetic phase in the doped compound has a lower coercivity Hc and more rectangular form of the hysteresis loop. The values of the exchange bias field HEB and coercivity are found to be strongly dependent on the cooling magnetic field Hcool. In sufficiently high magnetic fields, Hcool &gt; 5 kOe, HEB in the doped compound is about twice as low as in the parent compound. This difference is attributed to a lower exchange interaction and higher saturation magnetization of the ferromagnetic phase in (Nd0.9Y0.1)2/3Ca1/3MnO3.},

The effective piezomodulus is increased more than twice in the antiferromagnetic phase and it is reduced by a high magnetic field. The nature of the effect is in the joint contribution of both magnetoelectric and magnetoelastic interactions. The evolu-tion of this contribution in the magnetic field is caused by the growth of the magnetic energy including the spin reorientation. Additional data concerning the behavior of the high-frequency magnetocapacitance have been obtained.

  Abstract                 = {A theoretical and experimental study of the electron structure and nature of the chemical bonds in FeTe compounds in antiferromagnetic (AFM) and paramagnetic phases. It is established that the nature of the chemical bonds is mainly metallic, and the presence of covalent bonds Fe-Te and Te-Te helps to stabilize the structural distortions of the tetragonal phase of FeTe in the low-temperature region. It is found that the bicollinear AFM structure corresponds to the ground state of the FeTe compound and the calculated value of the magnetic moment MFe = -2.4μB is in good agreement with the data from neutron diffraction measurements. At the same time, the Fermi surface (FS) of the low-temperature AFM phase is radically different from the FS of the paramagnetic FeTe. Reconstructing the FS can lead to a sign change of the Hall coefficient observed in FeTe. The calculation results serve as evidence of the fact that the electron structures and magnetic properties of FeTe are well-described by the model of itinerant d-electrons and the density functional theory (DFT-GGA).},

  Abstract                 = {A 20% substitution of Bi with La in the perovskite Bi1-xLaxFe0.5Sc0.5O3 system obtained under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions has been found to induce an incommensurately modulated structural phase. The room-temperature x-ray and neutron powder diffraction patterns of this phase were successfully refined using the Imma(0,0,γ)s00 superspace group (γ=0.534(3)) with the modulation applied to Bi/La and oxygen displacements. The modulated structure is closely related to the prototype antiferroelectric structure of PbZrO3 which can be considered as the lock-in variant of the latter with γ=0.5. Below TN∼220 K, the neutron diffraction data provide evidence for a long-range G-type antiferromagnetic ordering commensurate with the average Imma structure. Based on a general symmetry consideration, we show that the direction of the spins is controlled by the antisymmetric exchange imposed by the two primary structural distortions, namely oxygen octahedral tilting and incommensurate atomic displacements. The tilting is responsible for the onset of a weak ferromagnetism, observed in magnetization measurements, whereas the incommensurate displacive mode is dictated by the symmetry to couple a spin-density wave. The obtained results demonstrate that antisymmetric exchange is the dominant anisotropic interaction in Fe3+-based distorted perovskites with a nearly quenched orbital degree of freedom.},

  Abstract                 = {Neutron powder diffraction measurements on the 35 % La-substituted Bi1-xLaxFe0.5Sc0.5O3 composition revealed that the samples obtained under high-pressure (6 GPa) and higherature (1500 K) conditions crystalize into a distorted perovskite structure with the orthorhombic Pnma symmetry and the unit cell parameters: ao = 5.6745(2) Å, bo = 7.9834(3) Å and co = 5.6310(2) Å. A long-range magnetic ordering takes place below 220 K and implies a G-type magnetic structure with the moments 4.10(4)μB per Fe aligned predominately along the orthorhombic c-axis. The space group representation theory using the orthorhombic symmetry yields four bi-linear coupling schemes for the magnetic order parameters imposed by antisymmetric exchange interactions. The couplings are analysed based on symmetry adapted distortion modes defined in respect of the undistorted cubic perovskite structure. The approach allows a quantitative estimation of the coupling strength. It is shown that the experimentally found spin configuration combines the magnetic order parameters coupled by the atomic displacement modes with the largest amplitudes. The results indicate that the antisymmetric exchange is the dominant anisotropic term which fully controls the direction of the Fe3+ spins in the distorted perovskite lattice.},

In particular, the obtained pressure derivatives of susceptibility dlnχ/dP for cerium, samarium and ytterbium tetraborides are -2, -0.6 and +2.7 (in units of Mbar-1), respectively, which are characteristic for the exchange-enhanced itinerant paramagnetism, Van Vleck ionic paramagnetism with a stable f-shell, and the magnetism of rare-earth ions in the intermediate valence state.},

The concentration of strontium in the samples was 0.01, 0.005 and 0.001. In the temperature range T  TN (where TN is the Neel temperature) a transition to the metallic type of conductivity was observed. Nonlinear effects in low-temperature conductivity, magnetoresistivity, as well as current-controlled negative differential resistance were found. It was established that the nonlinear behavior of conductivity intensified with decreasing the strontium concentration. For temperatures T < 10 K, the effect of positive magnetoresistance was observed. It is suggested that this effect can be attributed to the presence of a new low-- temperature magnetic phase (spin density waves).},

Field cooled magnetic hysteresis loops exhibit shifts toward negative direction of the magnetic field axis. The values of exchange field H EB and coercivity HC are found to be strongly dependent of temperature and strength of the cooling magnetic field Hcool. These effects are attributed to evolution of the FM phase content and a size of FM clusters. A contribution to the total magnetization of the system due to the FM phase has been evaluated. The exchange bias effect decreases with increasing temperature up to TC and vanishes above this temperature with disappearance of FM phase. Relaxation of a non-equilibrium magnetic state of the compound manifests itself through a training effect also observed while studying EB in Nd2/3Ca1/3MnO3.},

  Abstract                 = {The exchange bias (EB) phenomenon has been found in Nd2/3Ca1/3MnO3 perovskite. The phenomenon manifests itself as a negative horizontal shift of magnetization hysteresis loops. The EB phenomenon is evident of an interface exchange coupling between coexisting antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) phases and confirms the phase separated state of the compound at low temperatures. The EB effect is found to be strongly dependent on the cooling magnetic field and the temperature, which is associated with the evolution of spontaneous AFM-FM phase separated state of the compound. Analysis of magnetic hysteresis loops has shown that ferromagnetic moment MFM originating from the FM clusters saturates in a relatively low magnetic field about H ∼ 0.4 T. The obtained saturation value MFM (1 T) ~ 0.45 μB is in a good agreement with our previous neutron diffraction data.},

Without an external magnetic field the results reproduce the data from direct static measurements. A magnetic field opens up an additional piezomagnetic response channel with an amplitude that is linear in the field strength. The efficiencies of the two channels become equal in the antiferromagnetic state for H ~ 3 T. Above the Neel temperature the mechanism for the first channel ceases to operate, while the piezomagnetic response associated with the new channel falls off approximately exponentially. The sound speeds for the different crystallographic directions are measured and the components of the elastic modulus tensor are calculated.},

  Abstract                 = {The magnetic properties of Fe1+yTe single crystals (y≃ 0.10.18) were studied at temperatures 4.2300K. At an ambient pressure, with decreasing temperature a drastic drop in χ(T) was confirmed at T≃ 6065K, which appears to be closely related to the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering. It is found that the magnitudes of the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility Δχ in the AFM phase are close in the studied samples, whereas the sign of the anisotropy apparently depends on the small variations of the excess iron y in Fe1+yTe samples. The performed DFT calculations of the electronic structure and magnetic properties for the stoichiometric FeTe compound indicate the presence of frustrated AFM ground states. There are very close energies and magnetic moments for the double stripe configurations, with the AFM axes oriented either on the basal plane or along the [0 0 1] direction. Presumably, both these configurations can be realized in Fe1+yTe single crystals, depending on the variations of the excess iron. This can provide different signs of magnetic anisotropy in the AFM phase, presently observed in the Fe1+yTe samples. For these types of AFM configuration, the calculations for the FeTe values of Δχ are consistent with our experimental data.},

  Abstract                 = {The electronic energy structures and magnetic properties of layered superconductors RNi2B2C, RFe4Al8, and FeSe are systematically studied, by using the density functional theory (DFT). The calculations allowed us to reveal a number of features of the electronic structure, which can cause the manifestation of peculiar structural, magnetic and superconducting properties of these systems. It is demonstrated that the Fermi energy EF is located close to the pronounced peaks of the electronic density of states (DOS). The main contribution to DOS at the Fermi level arises from 3d-electrons. The calculations of the pressure-dependent electronic structure and the magnetic susceptibility in the normal state indicate that the novel superconductors are very close to a magnetic instability with dominating spin paramagnetism. It is shown that experimental data on the pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature in FeSe correlate qualitatively with the calculated behavior of DOS at EF as a function of the pressure.},

A method for analyzing the experimental data is proposed in which the g-factors of the conduction electrons are computed on the basis of calculations of the spin-polarized electron structure of the band antiferromagnet taking spin-orbital interactions into account.

  Abstract                 = {The temperature dependences of the magnetization in manganites of different composition and structural morphology were measured in two cooling regimes, field cooling (FC) and zero-field cooling (ZFC), for two different orientations of a magnetic field, parallel and perpendicular to the c-axis. The following general tendencies were found: (1) The difference between the magnetizations MFC and MZFC at T = 5K increases with increasing magnetic field, reaching the maximum value in a magnetic field of about 2 kOe, and then drops in the range 2-5 kOe; (2) The field dependence of the "splitting" temperature T* below which the difference between the magnetizations MFC and MZFC appears can be reasonably well described by a power law with the exponent 2/3 as predicted by the theory of spin glasses. Both results are characteristic for single crystals, as well as for ceramics and films. On the other hand, the field dependence of the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility is different for samples with different degrees of magnetic ordering (Θ/TC). These results are consistent with the detected in the present study universality of the line separating the low-temperature region of irreversibility in the H-T phase diagram of manganites. Deviations from the T* H-line with the exponent 2/3 in strong magnetic fields, which are commonly associated with the appearance of the magnetization component transverse to the magnetic field, are typical for samples containing the antiferromagnetic phase. The interpretation takes into account the multi-phase nature of the systems, i.e., coexistence of spin glass with ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. The observed change in the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility with increasing magnetic field and the behavior of magnetic and thermomagnetic irreversibility are regarded as a manifestation of the spin-reorientation phase transition in an antiferromagnetic environment. This in turn initiates the transformation of the spin-glass-from the Ising- to the Heisenberg-type-which leads to the change in the exponent in the T*H diagram from 2/3 to 2. The observed phenomenon is universal-it was observed in manganites of different composition and structural morphology-and represents a particular type of polyamorphism, namely, spin-glass polyamorphism.},

  Abstract                 = {Experimental data on the temperature dependences of the magnetization of manganites, cobaltites, and ferrites are analyzed. Their common feature is magnetization irreversibility: below a temperature T* for a fixed field strength, the magnetization is different for cooling in a field (MFC) and in zero field (MZFC). It is shown that the T*(H) curve is universal for all the dispersed oxides (nanocompound, nanopowder) and is consistent with the theoretical Almeida-Thouless curve (T*~H2/3) over the entire range of magnetic fields. In the case of monolithic samples (single crystals, ceramics), in strong magnetic fields there is a transition to a quadratic dependence T* ~ H2 in agreement with the Gabay-Toulousse theory. This phenomenon is interpreted in terms of spin-glass polyamorphism.},

In zero magnetic field we observe an abnormally strong electromagnetic radiation induced by a transverse elastic wave. Usually a radiation of such intensity and polarization is observed only in metals subjected to a high magnetic field (the radiation is caused by the Hall current). We argue that in FeSe in zero magnetic field it is caused by the piezomagnetic effect which is most probably of dynamical origin. We find that the piezomagnetism survives under the transition from the normal to superconducting state. In the superconducting state the electromagnetic signal decreases with decreasing temperature that is connected with the change in the London penetration depth.},

  Abstract                 = {A detailed magnetization study for the novel FeSe superconductor is carried out to investigate the behavior of the intrinsic magnetic susceptibility χ in the normal state with temperature and under hydrostatic pressure. The temperature dependences of χ and its anisotropy Δχ = χ- χ are measured for FeSe single crystals in the temperature range 4.2-300 K, and a substantial growth of susceptibility with temperature is revealed. The observed anisotropy Δχ is very large and comparable to the averaged susceptibility at low temperatures. For a polycrystalline sample of FeSe, the significant pressure effect on χ is determined to be essentially dependent on temperature. Ab initio calculations of the pressure-dependent electronic structure and magnetic susceptibility indicate that FeSe is close to magnetic instability, with dominating enhanced spin paramagnetism. The calculated paramagnetic susceptibility exhibits a strong dependence on the unit cell volume and especially on the height Z of chalcogen species from the Fe plane. The change of Z under pressure determines a large positive pressure effect on χ, which is observed at low temperatures. It is shown that the literature experimental data on the strong and nonmonotonic pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature in FeSe correlate qualitatively with the calculated behavior of the density of electronic states at the Fermi level.},

  Abstract                 = {The magnetic and magnetotransport properties of the anion-deficient perovskites La1-xBaxCoO3-δ are studied. It is shown that a gradual transition from the metallic to the semiconductor conduction and from ferromagnetism to antiferromagnetism takes place when the oxygen content decreases. The magnetoresistance is maximal at low temperatures near the concentration limit of the magnetic phase transition. A large value of the magnetoresistance is explained by the magnetic-field induced transition to a more conductive ferromagnetic phase, which occurs simultaneously with the change of a spin state of cobalt ions.},

The magnetic behavior of the perovskite Nd2/3Ca1/3MnO3 is consistent with a cluster-glass magnetic state and inconsistent with the classical spin-glass state observed in a variety of disordered magnetic systems. We think that the cluster-glass magnetic behavior of Nd2/3Ca1/3MnO3 originates in a self-organized phase-separated state of the compound. A Cole-Cole analysis of the dynamic susceptibility at low temperatures reveals an extremely broad distribution of relaxation times, indicating that spins are frozen on a "macroscopic" time scale. Slow relaxation of the zero-field-cooled magnetization is also observed experimentally. This slow relaxation confirms the cluster-glass magnetic state of the compound. Two highly different relaxation mechanisms have been found: the first is characteristic of temperatures below the freezing temperature Tg ~ 60 K and the second, of higher temperatures.},

Clear experimental evidence of the cluster-glass magnetic behavior of this compound has been revealed. Well defined maxima in the in-phase linear ac susceptibility χ′(T) were observed, indicative of the magnetic glass transition at T g∼60 K. Strongly divergent zero-field-cooled and field-cooled static magnetizations and frequency dependent ac susceptibility are evident of the glassy-like magnetic state of the compound at low temperatures. The frequency dependence of the cusp temperature T max of the χ′(T) susceptibility was found to follow the critical slowing down mechanism. The Cole-Cole analysis of the dynamic susceptibility at low temperature has shown extremely broad distribution of relaxation times, indicating that spins are frozen at macroscopic time scale. Slow relaxation in the zero-field-cooled magnetization has been experimentally revealed. The obtained results do not agree with a canonical spin-glass state and indicate a cluster glass magnetic state of the compound below T g, associated with its antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic nano-phase segregated state. It was found that the relaxation mechanisms below the cluster glass freezing temperature T g and above it are strongly different. Magnetic field up to about μ 0H∼0.4 T suppresses the glassy magnetic state of the compound.},

The dc paramagnetic susceptibility of Gd was measured in the temperature range 295-365 K and under hydrostatic pressure up to 0.16 GPa, yielding values of the paramagnetic Curie temperature Θ and its pressure derivative. Based on the results of ab initio electronic structure calculations, the experimental behavior of Θ under hydrostatic pressure together with the literature data on the uniform and uniaxial pressure effects was examined within a mean-field like approach. For this purpose, the effective d-band susceptibility and the relevant exchange integrals were calculated as functions of the lattice parameters within the density functional theory. These calculations provided a reasonable description of the experimentally observed uniform pressure effect, but a less satisfactory description of the uniaxial pressure effect.},

The data obtained, such as strongly divergent ZFC and FC static magnetizations and frequency dependent ac susceptibility, are evident of the glassy magnetic state of the system. Well defined maxima Tmax in the in-phase linear ac susceptibility χ'curves were observed, indicating a spin-glass transition. Clear frequency dependence of the cusp temperature Tmax was found. The frequency dependence of Tmax was successfully analyzed by the dynamical scaling theory of a three-dimensional spin glass. Slow relaxation process and variety of relaxation times found imply a cluster glass magnetic state of the compound at low temperatures rather than a canonical spin glass state. The cluster glass state, accompanied by the multiple magnetic transitions of Nd2/3Ca1/3MnO3, might exist due to the competing interaction between the FM clusters and the AFM matrix induced by the complex nanophase segregated state of the compound.},

The regularities in the behavior of the superparamagnetic magnetoresistive effect in multilayer nanofilms Co/Cu(111) in a magnetic field, found in the work, indicate the influence of the electron size effect on the formation of clusters in these films. The results of measurements of the high-field magnetoresistive effect are reported for multilayer films [Co/Cu(111)]20 with a constant thickness of cobalt layers and the thickness of copper layer varying from film to film. It is found that an effective size of superparamagnetic formations is reduced in the films with thickness of the copper layers corresponding to the maxima of the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between cobalt layers. It is suggested that the observed "grinding" of superparamagnetic particles is caused by oscillating changes in the electron density in the interface layer Co/Cu, induced by electron quantum size effect in the copper layers.},

  Abstract                 = {We have studied by the electron-spin resonance (ESR) and static magnetic field techniques, the La 2/3Ba 1/3MnO 3 perovskite, which was previously shown to exhibit a martensitic phase transformation in the vicinity of T s∼200 K [Physical Review B 68, 054109 (2003)], leading to its structural phase-segregated state. Resonant absorptions reveal that in the temperature interval from 100 K to 340 K the compound represents a mixture of two ferromagnetic phases possessing different magnetizations, in varying proportions depending on the temperature, and a small amount of a paramagnetic phase. The results agree well with the previous neutron diffraction study. Applied in the ESR experiments, magnetic fields (2-6 kOe) strongly affect the magnetization curves: even magnetic field as high as 700 Oe modifies the anomaly in the phase transformation region and removes the difference between the zero-field cooled and field-cooled magnetization curves, which implies that the difference in the magnetic susceptibility of the coexisting phases is small and the magnetic domain configuration can be easily changed.},

La0.5Ba0.5CoO3 is an insulating ferromagnet whereas La0.5Ba0.5CoO2.75 is a pure antiferromagnet in which the oxygen vacancies are disordered. The ordering of the oxygen vacancies leads to the appearance of a ferromagnetic component, apparently because of the formation of a noncollinear magnetic structure. The antiferromagnet-"ferromagnet" transition is accompanied by a giant magnetoresistance. It is suggested that in the ferromagnetic oxidized compounds, the Co3+ and Co4+ ions adopt intermediate spin states, whereas in the antiferromagnetic (Co4+-free) compositions, the Co3+ ions have a high-spin state (CoO5 pyramids) with a dominant low-spin state (CoO6 octahedra). In both the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic compounds, superexchange via oxygen plays an essential role in determining the magnetic properties.},

The features in the temperature behavior of elastic characteristics of the neodymium ferroborate and its behavior in the external magnetic field, applied in the basic plane of the crystal, permit us to suppose that the transition to an incommensurate spiral phase is realized in the system.

  Abstract                 = {The magnetic susceptibility χ of the FeSe and FeTe compounds, which form the simplest FeSe(Te) system of the novel iron-based superconductors, is studied in the normal state under hydrostatic pressure. A substantial positive pressure effect on χ is detected at low temperatures for both compounds. At room temperature, this effect is found to be also strong, but it is negative for FeSe and positive for FeTe. Ab initio calculations of the pressure dependent electronic structure and magnetic susceptibility indicate that FeSe and FeTe are close to magnetic instability with dominating enhanced spin paramagnetism. The calculated paramagnetic susceptibility exhibits a strong dependence on the unit cell volume and the height Z of chalcogen species from the Fe plane. The observed large positive pressure effects on χ in FeTe and FeSe at low temperatures are related to considerable sensitivity of the paramagnetism to the internal parameter Z. It is shown that available experimental data on the strong and nonmonotonic pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature in FeSe correlate qualitatively with the calculated behavior of the density of electronic states at the Fermi level.},

The potential and the elastic components of the electron sound demonstrate qualitatively different dependencies on the electron relaxation rate: while the phase of the potential increases with temperature, the phase of elastic displacement decreases. This effect is explained within the multiband model, in which the potential is attributed to the ballistic quasiwave, while the elastic component is associated with the zero-sound wave. We observed a mysterious property of the superconducting state: all manifestations of the potential accompanying the lattice deformations, including usual sound wave, disappear below T c in almost jumplike manner.},

  Abstract                 = {The low temperature specific heat and magnetic characteristics of Nd 2/3Ca1/3MnO3 perovskite are studied in a wide range of magnetic fields (up to 9 T). Temperature dependent specific heat data show a broadened Schottky-like anomaly below 20 K caused by splitting of the Nd3 ions ground-state doublet in the effective molecular field H ex, determined by exchange interaction between Nd and Mn spin systems supplemented by an applied external magnetic field. Existence of the splitting at zero magnetic field and expressed field dependence is the evidence of a strong exchange coupling between Nd and Mn magnetic subsystems. The Nd-ions magnetic ordering leads to an additional contribution to the magnetic moment of the system below 30 K, producing anomalies of the magnetic loss and field-cooled and zero-field-cooled magnetizations. The observed broadened Schottky-like anomalies are fitted for each applied magnetic field by the sum of three Schottky functions. Applied magnetic field extends the anomaly region and shifts it to higher temperatures. Splitting of the higher crystal field Kramers doublets gives an additional contribution to the heat capacity in magnetic fields. The ground state doublet g-factors g|| and g⊥ were estimated to be 3.4 and 2.2, respectively, and Hex was estimated to be 9 T. The Nd3 ions magnetic moment estimated from the magnetization data agrees with the value obtained from the specific heat data.},

  Abstract                 = {The temperature dependence of the resistance of a La2CuO 4 + δ (δ ≈ 0.05) single crystal with the Neel temperature T N ≈ 205 K was investigated in order to establish the correlation between the transport and magnetic properties of the crystal. The R(T) dependence near T N reveals a kink related to the enhancement of sample's conductivity upon the transition from the antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic state. With an increase in temperature far above T N, the transition from the dielectric (dR/dT &lt; 0) to metal (dR/dT &gt; 0) occurs. The observed behavior of resistance is attributed to delocalization of carriers above T N.},

  Abstract                 = {The magnetic susceptibility χ of FeTex compounds () was studied under hydrostatic pressure up to 2kbar at fixed temperatures of 55, 78 and 300K. Measurements were taken both for polycrystalline and single crystalline samples. At ambient pressure, with decreasing temperature a drastic drop in χ(T) was confirmed at K, which appears to be closely related to antiferromagnetic ordering. The obtained results have revealed a puzzling growth of susceptibility under pressure, and this effect is enhanced by lowering the temperature. To shed light on the pressure effects in the magnetic properties of FeTe, abinitio calculations of its volume dependent band structure and the exchange enhanced paramagnetic susceptibility were performed within the local spin density approximation.},

The superconducting transition was observed at Tc∼8K and 13.6-14.2K in FeSe0.963 and FeSe0.5Te0.5, respectively. For most of the samples, nonlinearity of the magnetization curves in the normal state gives evidence of a common, substantial presence of ferromagnetic impurities in these compounds. By taking these impurity effects into account, the intrinsic magnetic susceptibility χ of FeSe0.963, FeSe0.5Te0.5, and FeTe was estimated to increase gradually with Te content. For FeTe a drastic drop in χ(T) with decreasing temperature was found at TN∼70K, which is presumably related to antiferromagnetic ordering.

Applied magnetic fields lead to the drop of the low temperature specific heat by more than 2 orders, which implies a large magnetic contribution. Experimental data were successfully fitted by the sum of the hyperfine C hyp, the linear T-dependent C sg and the spin waves C sw contributions. The C sg attributed to the glassy state of the magnetic systems of the studied insulating compounds exponentially decreases with the increase of H up to ∼5 T. The C sw providing the best fitting of the experimental data is attributed to the ferromagnetic spin waves with pseudo gap Δ(H) in the spin-wave spectrum which increases linearly with the increase of the applied magnetic field. The Δ(0)∼0.8 K is approximately the same for both compounds studied.},

Experimental data and "first principles" calculations of the electronic structure and paramagnetic contributions to the susceptibility indicate that YNi5, LaNi5, and CeNi5 are close to a quantum critical point. It is found that the van Vleck orbital contribution to the magnetic susceptibility is 15-20% in these exchange-enhanced paramagnetic materials and should be taken into account in analyzing experimental data on χ and dlnχ/dlnV. Calculations of the magnetic-field induced moments for atoms in the unit cell of YNi5 reveal an inhomogeneous distribution of the magnetization density and a nontrivial competition between the spin and orbital moments.},

The interaction of a nanotube with PSE leads to a downshift of the band assigned in the Raman spectrum to the tangential mode of the hybrid with respect to the position of this mode in the spectrum of the pristine SWCNT. The MD simulation demonstrates that the direct interaction between SWCNT and GOX is very strong. This interaction can be expected to change the structure of the enzyme and to significantly affect its activity. The MD simulation also shows that only one PSE molecule used as a linker between SWCNT and GOX is enough to keep GOX near the nanotube surface in the water surrounding and to prevent strong interaction between SWCNT and GOX. However, to stabilize this nanobiohybrid in water at least two PSE linkers are needed. The molecular structure of PSE is determined using the density functional theory approach (DFT/B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p). The geometries and the relative stabilities of all possible PSE conformers are characterized in the calculations. High structural flexibility of the PSE molecule is demonstrated. Calculations (at the M05-2X level of theory) have also been performed on the structures and the interaction energies of complexes formed by various SWCNTs with PSE and pyrene. Pyrene interacts strongly with the surface of carbon nanotubes with different chiralities, but the interaction with zigzag nanotubes is stronger than with armchair ones of the same diameter. Increasing the diameter of the SWCNTs leads to a higher adsorption energy, reaching the maximum value for graphene (-20.8 kcal/mol).},

  Abstract                 = {The magnetic properties of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) modified with cobalt nanoparticles were studied in the temperatures and magnetic field range of (4.2-290) K and (0.03-5) T, respectively. Nanoparticles of cobalt encapsulated inside MWCNTs were obtained by using the chemical vapor deposition technique. The low temperature SQUID magnetization measurements were supplemented with structural investigations by means of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy as well as thermogravimetric and X-ray diffraction analysis. X-ray diffraction revealed the presence of MWCNTs, f.c.c. Co and h.c.p. Co phases. The magnetic characterization provided the remanent magnetization value (MR) of about 0.07 emu/g (∼40% of the saturation moment), while the coercive field (HC) value amounts to 600 Oe. Both parameters MR and HC slightly decrease with the rise of temperature. The substantial magnetization increase observed at low temperatures suggests the existence of nano Co clusters (in the atomic scale size).},

  Abstract                 = {The generation of defects in NbSe2 single crystals by electron irradiation has been investigated by a combination of ac susceptibility and structural measurements. Remarkably, thanks to the layered structure of NbSe2, we show that electronic irradiation cannot only create point defects but also in-plane extended defects, which modify anisotropically the ac response. Indeed, the analysis of the onset of the nonlinear susceptibility response, Hacl(T), as a function of irradiation dose and field orientation shows a correlated increase in the density of anisotropic defects induced by electron irradiation. Also, we measured a decrease in the strength of the pinning (Labusch) constant αL accounting for elastic vortex oscillations within the linear Campbell regime for high-dose-irradiated samples in a transverse field, again compatible with the presence of planar defects hindering vortex pinning. X-ray powder diffraction and TEM electron diffraction measurements suggest these in-plane defects may result from the rupture of Se-Se bonds and the formation of nanorods and nanowires by NbSe2 sheet rolling.},

  Abstract                 = {The temperature dependences of resistance, R (T), of two single-crystals La2 CuO4 + δ samples have been studied with the aim to detect a possible change in the R (T) behavior induced by paramagnetic-antiferromagnetic (PM-AFM) transition. One of the samples with δ ≲ 0.01, was fairly homogeneous in oxygen distribution (not phase-separated) with Néel temperature TN ≈ 266 K. Conductivity of this sample has been determined by Mott's variable-range hopping below TN. The other, far less resistive, sample with δ ≈ 0.05, was inhomogeneous (phase-separated) showing both PM-AFM (TN ≈ 205 K) and superconducting (Tc ≈ 25 K) transitions. It is found that for the homogeneous sample the resistivity decreases above TN far faster with temperature than below it (for both directions of measuring current, parallel and perpendicular to basal CuO2 planes). A similar behavior of conductivity near PM-AFM transition is also found for the phase-separated and less resistive sample. In this case a clear kink in R (T) curve near TN ≈ 205 K can be seen. Furthermore, a transition to metallic (dR / dT &gt; 0) behavior occurs far enough above TN. The observed behavior of the samples studied is related to increased delocalization of charge carriers above TN. This is in accordance with decrease in the AFM correlation length and corresponding enhancement of the hole mobility above TN known for low-doped lanthanum cuprates.},

All the specific heat data show broadened Schottky-like anomaly below 20 K. We suppose that such a behavior originates from the Nd magnetic ordering caused by the splitting of the Nd 3+ ions ground-state doublet (GSD) in the effective molecular field Hex of Mn spin system supplemented by an applied external magnetic field. The zero field GSD splitting is an evidence of a strong exchange coupling between Nd and Mn magnetic subsystems. The Nd-ions magnetic ordering introduces an additional contribution to the ferromagnetic moment producing anomalies of the field-cooled and zero-field-cooled magnetizations of the system below 28 K. The broadened Schottky-like anomalies found are fitted for every field by a set of three Schottky functions. Applied magnetic field extends the anomaly region and shifts it to the higher temperatures. Splitting of the higher crystal field Kramers doublets gives an additional contribution to the heat capacity under magnetic fields. The GSD g-factors g|| and g⊥ was estimated as 3.4 and 2.2, respectively, and Hex as 9 T.},

Superconducting behavior was found below 26K, whereas a distinct peculiarity in the low-field dependence of the magnetic susceptibility χ(T) was clearly observed at TM≃135K, which resembles a weak ferromagnetic (FM) response with saturation magnetic moment of about 10-4μB per formula unit at 50K. The transition at TM is presumably not governed by magnetic impurities but rather correlated with the antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition in undoped LaFeAsO at about the same temperature. We suggest that the observed magnetic properties of the LaFeAsO0.85F0.1 sample are due to an interplay of FM and AFM transitions, and are presumably related with an intrinsic feature of a small portion of the undoped LaFeAsO phase inherent in our sample. In order to shed light on the problem of magnetic instability of the LaFeAsO, ab initio DFT calculations of the electronic structure and paramagnetic susceptibility were performed within the local spin density approximation. It is shown that a V-shaped peculiarity in the density of electronic states close to the Fermi level can govern magnetic properties of LaFeAsO with fluorine doping and/or oxygen deficiency.},

  Abstract                 = {The Bi 1-xA xFeO 3- δ (A∈=∈Sr,∈Pb) systems have been studied using the X-ray, neutron powder diffraction and magnetization measurements in a magnetic field up to 14 T. It was found that around x ∼ 0.06 the crystal symmetry changes from a rhombohedral (space group R3c) to pseudo-tetragonal. In the composition range 0.07 ≥ x ≥ 0.14 the phases with different symmetry of the unit cell coexist independent of synthesis conditions. The neutron powder diffraction shows that the iron ions have average oxidation state close to 3+. The magnetic structure for Bi 0.5Sr 0.5FeO 3- δ is found to be G-type antiferromagnetic with magnetic moment of about 3.8 μ B/Fe 3+. The weak ferromagnetic state due to magnetoelectric interactions was revealed in the lightly doped rhombohedrally distorted compositions. No evidence for a spontaneous magnetization was observed for the pseudo-tetragonal phases. These compositions show irreversible nonlinear magnetization vs. field behavior apparently due to small local deviations from the collinearity of the magnetic moments.},

The superconducting transition was observed at TC ~ 8, 13.6-14.2, and 26 K in FeSe0.963, FeSe0.5Te0.5, and LaFeAsO0.85F0.1, respectively. The intrinsic magnetic susceptibility χ in the series of FeSe0.963, FeSe0.5Te0.5 and FeTe is found to increase gradually approximately 10 times as much with Te content. A kink in the low-field dependence of χ(T) was detected at TM ~ 135 K for LaFeAsO0.85F0.1. The electronic structures and paramagnetic susceptibilities of the studied compounds are calculated ab initio in external magnetic field as a function of atomic volume and structural parameter Z, which specifies the relative height of chalcogen atoms above iron plane. The calculated field-induced magnetic moments and their volume derivatives indicate that these systems are in a close proximity to a
quantum critical point. For FeSe and FeTe the calculated paramagnetic susceptibilities reveal a large magnetovolume effect and a drastic sensitivity to parameter Z.},

The amplitude-phase relations characterizing the behavior of electron sound in Ga single crystals are determined experimentally. A model problem of excitation of electron sound in a compensated metal with equivalent bands is solved for a finite sample with diffuse scattering of electrons at the interfaces. It is determined that the displacement amplitude of the receiving interface is two orders of magnitude greater than the elastic amplitude characteristic for the wave due to electron pressure. It is established that the changes occurring in the amplitude and phase of the electron sound waves at a superconducting transition do not depend on the path traversed by the wave, i.e. they refer only to the behavior of the conversion coefficient.},

  Abstract                 = {A direct evidence of X-ray scattering by electron modulation in a charge-density wave metal dominating over the periodic lattice distortion (PLD) is presented for hexagonal modification of niobium diselenide (2H-NbSe 2). Namely, new pronounced features appear in X-ray diffraction below TCDW indexed in the space group D3h 1 with a doubled in-plane parameter a and the inversion symmetry axis instead of screw one. Above TCDW transition, the space group D6h 4 with lattice parameters a0=3.44, c=12.8 is revealed in agreement with published data. The observed difference is due in particular to different mechanisms of neutron and X-rays scattering by spatial distribution of nuclei or electron density, respectively. A CDW formation in 2H-NbSe 2 is then accompanied by spatial modulation of electron density with periodicity 2a, manifested in X-ray scattering with a nuclei shift insufficient for neutron scattering. Indeed, numerous studies show enigmatic absence of Fermi-surface nesting in 2H-NbSe2 and, eventually, long coherence length. Within McMillan's consideration it means that in this case, electron modulation should dominate the distortion of periodic crystal potential rather than commonly observed periodic lattice distortion, e.g. in TaSe2.},

  Abstract                 = {The intensity of x-ray scattering in the layered metal 2H-Nb Se2 has been investigated experimentally in the temperature range below the temperature of the transition into the charge-density wave state. It is shown that the relation I∼ (TC -T)-γ with TC ∼30 K and γ=1.6±0.2, as is characteristic for quasi-elastic (quasi-Bragg) scattering, describes the scattering intensity. Such scattering is strong when the width Δ εXR of the spectral distribution of the x-ray radiation is greater than the spectral width of the fluctuations Δ εf of the order parameter. The inequality Δ εf <Δ εf holds for scattering of slow neutrons, for which quasi-elastic scattering is immeasurably weak.},

Isothermal heat capacity and magnetization measurements were performed to determine the heat capacity jump at the HC2-TC transition line. With these results the validity of the Second Ehrenfest relation for this type II superconductor was checked. The temperature dependences of the heat capacity and the thermal expansion along the crystallographic axis s{cyrillic} were measured. Both properties manifest the sharp features of BCS-type at the superconducting transition and more diffuse features at the CDW transitions. These results, together with the First Ehrenfest relation, allowed us to estimate the critical temperature derivative on uniaxial pressure applied along the hexagonal axis s{cyrillic}, pIIs{cyrillic}, (∂ TSN / ∂ p/ / c)P → 0 = + 1.45 ± 0.05 K / GPa. The same methodology has been applied to the CDW transition, where a positive derivative on uniaxial pressure was deduced.},

Charge ordering occurs at 290 K in the doped compound. Diluting of Nd subsystem by Y in the parent perovskite has opposite effects on the temperatures of magnetic and charge orderings: the temperatures of all magnetic transformations are reduced in the doped compound by 20-30 K, while the charge ordering one increases by ∼80 K.

At low temperatures, three different long-range magnetic orderings consistent with a phase separation scenario have been observed in the doped compound (Nd0.9Y0.1)2/3Ca1/3MnO3 by neutron-diffraction study: the antiferromagnetic orderings of PCE and DE types existing below ∼110 and ∼60 K, respectively, and the ferromagnetic one of B type existing below ∼42. Magnetic phase transformations temperatures as well as those of charge ordering have been found to be structural-dependent. Y-doping leads to the decrease of the anisotropy of the orthorhombic Pnma crystal lattice b/√2c, which causes a decrease of the indirect exchange parameters in the system and thus a decrease in the magnetic transformation temperatures for 20-30 K in the doped compound. Doping leads as well to the higher level of the coherent Jahn-Teller distortions of the MnO6 octahedra in the 200-300 K temperature region, which results in the increase of the charge ordering temperature for ∼80 K.},

  Abstract                 = {93Nb NMR studies were carried out for a single crystal of NbSe2 at 73.328MHz in the temperature range 9-300K to investigate the normal and charge density wave (CDW) states. Detailed analysis of the NMR line shape of the central transition using a classical incommensurate model reveals the change in the conduction electron spin dynamics from above TCDW. An increase of the Knight shift below TCDW reflects modification to the uniform part of the conduction electron density of states. As suggested theoretically, the Knight shift distribution is found to be directly proportional to the square of the amplitude of the CDW. The results further indicate an incommensurate CDW state in 2H-NbSe2. Analysis of the NMR spectra using the McMillan incommensurate model suggests a large value of the discommensuration parameter (γ) which is almost temperature independent, in contrast to the much smaller value previously reported in the case of 2H-TaSe2.},

In addition, the measured pressure dependence of the Ńel temperature, dTN /dP=0. 1±0.1 K/kbar, is roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding value for the pure chromium.

Within this method the anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility in hexagonal close-packed transition metals is evaluated for the first time. This anisotropy is owing to the orbital Van Vleck-like paramagnetic susceptibility, which is revealed to be substantial in transition-metal systems due to hybridization effects in the electronic structure. It is demonstrated that compounds TiCo, Ni3 Al, Y Co2, Ce Co2, Y Ni5, La Ni5, and Ce Ni5 are strong paramagnets close to the quantum critical point. For these systems the Stoner approximation underestimates the spin susceptibility, whereas the calculated field-induced spin moments provide a good description of the large paramagnetic susceptibilities and magnetovolume effects. It is revealed that an itinerant description of hybridized f electrons produces magnetic properties of the compounds Ce Co2, Ce Ni5, U Al3, U Ga 3, U Si3, and U Ge3 in close agreement with experiment. In the uranium compounds U X3 the strong spin-orbit coupling together with hybridization effects give rise to peculiar magnetic states in which the field-induced spin moments are antiparallel to the external field, and the magnetic response is dominated by the orbital contribution.},

Magnetic properties of various G-FRP Dewar-purpose materials are explored with a χ-meter furnished with a RF SQUID magnetometer. The Dewar materials and multilayer insulation effects contributing to the magnetic response signal are analyzed. It has also been discovered that field noise caused by the magnetization of the Dewar materials can be suppressed substantially by using special glass-epoxy technologies.

Moreover, measurements can be performed for a field oriented along the crystallographic axis in contrast to the torque technique that is routinely used. Here we present magnetostriction measurement on a high-quality single-crystalline sample for temperatures 0.25-8.0 K using a sensitive capacitance dilatometer.

The functions dMn-O (T) and (T) are found to have anomalies in the charge-ordering range (Tco ≈212 K). The sharp decrease of the diagonal dMn-O2s agrees with phase-transition notions, according to which the spatial modulation of the charge density is due to the modulation of the Mn-Mn bond lengths. The most likely driving forces of the transition are the Peierls lattice instability and Jahn-Teller stability of the Mn O6 octahedron at the Mn3+ ions. The hysteresis of the temperature dependence (T) in the paramagnetic region shows indirectly that structural phase separation occurs together with the transition. The parameters of the function (T) indicate that ferromagnetic clusters consisting of one, two, or three ion pairs Mn3+ - Mn4+ form in the system in the temperature intervals 274 K≤T≤290 K, 224 K≤T≤252 K, and 130 K≤T≤198 K, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {B12-cluster compounds have attracted considerable interest in recent years. This is above all due to the unique combination of their physical properties, such as high melting point, hardness, thermal and chemical stability, and rich magnetic properties. Among them, the rare earth dodecaborides (REB12), which crystallize in the NaCl based fcc structure, exhibit a variety of physical properties which result mainly from strong electron correlations of the 4f shell of rare earth ions. Thus e.g., LuB12 with a fully occupied 4f shell is a metal which becomes superconducting below 0.4 K, YbB12 is a Kondo insulator, and TmB12, ErB12, HoB12, DyB12 and TbB12 are metals which order antiferromagnetically in the Kelvin temperature range. In our review we present results of recent investigations performed on these materials. Attention is devoted above all to superconducting and magnetic properties of dodecaborides, however, also their structural, thermal and transport properties, as well as lattice and magnetic excitation spectra are presented and discussed. Results of first principles electronic structure calculations are shown too.},

The bulk properties of the borides are analyzed on the basis of the calculated equations of states and balanced crystal orbital overlap populations. Our calculations indicate that hexaborides with divalent metals, CaB6, SrB6, BaB 6, and YbB6, are semiconductors with small energy gaps. The metallic MB6 hexaborides with trivalent M atoms are found to possess larger bulk moduli values. For dodecaborides the bulk moduli are found to be higher for MB12 with increased filling of the conduction band (ZrB12, HfB12, UB12) in comparison with M 3+B12 compounds. The total energy calculations for different magnetic configurations in YbB12 point to the possibility of antiferromagnetic coupling between Yb3+ ions.},

The components of the tensor of the elastic moduli of this system are determined. A structural phase transition and a transition of the magnetic subsystem into an antiferromagnetically ordered state appear in the temperature dependences of the sound velocities and absorption. The magnetic field dependences of the velocities of transverse sound exhibit singularities in the form of jumps at a magnetic field equal to the field of the spin-flop transition of the antiferromagnetic subsystem. Theoretical analysis shows that the observed behavior of the acoustic characteristics are associated not with the rare-earth subsystem of ferroborate but rather with the renormalization of the exchange interaction between iron ions as a result of the magnetoelastic coupling.},

Magnetic susceptibilities of CrB2 and FeGe2 compounds were studied under hydrostatic pressure at fixed temperatures, 77 and 300 K. In order to analyze the experimental magnetovolume effects, the electronic structures were calculated ab initio in external magnetic field as a function of atomic volume by employing a full-potential LMTO method. The calculated field-induced magnetic moments and their volume derivatives compare favorably with the experimental pressure effects in magnetic properties of CrB2 and FeGe2. The main role of pressure in high-Tc superconductivity of LaFeAsO is found to reduce density of states at the Fermi level and to suppress ferromagnetic spin fluctuations.},

  Abstract                 = {In the compound YbPb3, the anomalous diamagnetism of which is due to the presence of a point of degeneracy of the energy bands near the Fermi level, the influence of hydrostatic pressure of up to 2 kbar on the magnetic susceptibility at fixed temperatures of 78 and 300 K. A theoretical analysis of the experimental data shows that appreciable growth of the diamagnetism under pressure comes about because a point of band degeneracy is approaching the Fermi level. The initial position of the band with respect to the Fermi level is refined, and its dependence on the atomic volume is determined.},

The symmetry of all 36 vibrational excitations predicted by group-theoretical analysis is determined. The temperature behavior of the scattering spectra indicates that there is no phase transition in the temperature interval studied. Low-energy electronic transitions are found between the levels of the ground-state multiplet F67 of Tb3+ split in a crystal field with symmetry C2. It is determined that the first excited electronic quasidoublet consists of two singlet levels with different symmetry and is separated by a quite high (∼75 cm-1) energy from the ground-state quasidoublet. The behavior of all experimentally observed levels in external magnetic fields H⊥ C2 and H C2 is investigated. The results confirm that a virtually pure case of Ising anisotropy is realized at low temperatures and the magnet studied in the present work can be regarded as a system of two-level magnetic ions.},

This sensitivity is due to the interaction of sound waves with the antiferromagnetic domain structure. Acoustic "nonreciprocity" of the same nature has also been observed.

  Abstract                 = {Phosphorescence spectra of crystalline ortho-bromobenzophenone (2-bromobenzophenone, 2BrBP) were measured from 1.6 K to room temperature. A cardinal emission mechanism crossover occurs within this temperature range. At low temperature the phosphorescence spectrum is a superposition of two similar sets of equidistant bands spaced by the CO stretch frequency. We ascribe these two sets to the emission of two different conformers, one of which is metastable and does not manifest itself above approximately 70 K. The presence of two conformers is explained by the fact that the 2BrBP molecule deforms considerably upon excitation. The emission from the stable conformer survives up to approximately 140 K or even higher. At roughly 60 K and higher, another type of emission reveals itself in the shape of two very broad, partly overlapping bands, which gains in intensity with increasing temperature. Above 150 K only this two-hump feature is observed in phosphorescence spectra. Additional phosphorescence experiments were carried out to elucidate the nature of this spectrum, including phosphorescence measurements of 2BrBP in ethanol solutions as well as time-resolved and varying-excitation-intensity measurements from crystals. Based on results of all the experiments reported here and on our own single-crystal x-ray structure data we conclude that the above two-band spectrum recorded near room temperature is due to the emission of single-photon bimolecular triplet excimer formed by the carbonyl groups of two neighboring 2-bromobenzophenone molecules. This is the first time that a bimolecular excimer has been observed and reliably identified in a benzophenone derivative solid.},

  Abstract                 = {The electronic structures of RB6, RB12 and RB 2C2 borides are studied ab initio by using the full-potential linear muffin-tin orbital method. This study includes the promising materials for spin electronics with reported high temperature ferromagnetism, namely, doped divalent hexaborides CaB6, SrB 6, BaB6, and the CaB2C2 compound, as well as Kondo semiconductors, SmB6 and YbB12. For CaBe and SrB6 a semiconducting band structure has been obtained, whereas a semimetallic ground state is revealed for CaB2C2 and doped hexaborides. For YB6, LaB6, CaB2C 2 and the semimetallic Ba1-xLaxB6 alloys we have performed spin-polarized band structure calculations in an external field to evaluate the induced spin and orbital magnetic moments. These calculations indicate a feasibility of the field-induced weak ferromagnetic phase in ~CaB2C2 and the La doped hexaborides. The LSDA and GGA calculations for different spin configurations of YbB12 point to a possibility of antiferromagnetic coupling between Yb3+ ions. For SmB6 and YbB12 our LSDA, GGA, and LSDA+U calculations have not revealed the hybridization gap for configurations with trivalent Sm3+ and Yb3+.},

The method does not require the flux flow regime and allows us to measure the Magnus force almost everywhere over the range of the existence of the mixed state. We have measured the field dependence of the Magnus force in nonmagnetic borocarbides (electron-type conductors) and in Nb (hole-type conductor). It is found that in borocarbides the sign of the Magnus force in the mixed state has the same sign as the Lorentz force acting on charge carriers in the normal state, and its value (counted per one vortex of unit length) has only a weak dependence on the magnetic field. In Nb the gyroscopic force changes its sign under transition from the normal to the mixed state. The essential point of the method is the registration of the electromagnetic radiation from the superconductor at zero magnetic field caused by the acoustic Stewart-Tolman effect.},

Pr0.9MnO2.90 is a ferromagnetic insulator with Tc= 120 K. In this sample a transition from an orbitally ordered phase to an orbitally disordered phase occurs over a wide range of temperatures. The properties of the samples are explained by the hypothesis that a portion of the praseodymium ions (up to 5%) can be substituted by trivalent manganese ions without forming oxygen vacancies. Upon oxidation of the samples, vacancies of the praseodymium cations appear, while the oxygen skeleton is preserved.},

Our results show that the decrease of the unit cell volume under pressure is followed by decrease of Θ (≈TC). As it was evaluated from X-ray study, the substitution of U by Th leads to a nearly linear increase of the unit cell volume V, i.e. to negative chemical pressure effect. The chemical pressure effect appears to be of the same order as the total change of TC induced by hydrostatic pressure in these alloys but opposite in sign. The decrease of TC with alloying is presumably caused by a change of 5f state hybridization with conduction electrons.},

A capital crossover in the emission mechanism takes place within this temperature range, leaving at room temperature only a broad two-hump feature. Additional phosphorescence experiments, carried out to understand the nature of this spectrum, include measurements from 2Br-BP solutions in ethanol as well as time-resolved and varying-excitation-intensity measurements from crystals. Based on results of these experiments and on our own single-crystal X-ray structure data, we conclude that the above two-band spectrum recorded near room temperature is due to the emission of single-photon bi-molecular triplet excimer formed by the carbonyl groups of two neighbor 2-bromobenzophenone molecules.},

  Abstract                 = {The pumping of the energy of a longitudinal sound by a quantum spin chain with the alternation of coupling constants is studied theoretically. It is shown that the power of the sound wave, absorbed by the dimerized spin chain, is zero in the dynamical regime, i.e., at times, smaller than relaxation times. In the steady-state regime, for times, larger than the relaxation time, the dimerized quantum spin chain can absorb the power of the sound. We have shown that the absorption of the sound exists when the frequency of the wave is between two threshold values, related to two critical fields, at which quantum phase transitions take place. Contrary, the calculated magnetic field dependence of the absorbed power of the sound does not clearly manifest two critical fields. Nevertheless, we have shown that it is possible to extract the information about the value of the field, at which the spin gap of low-lying excitations is closed, from the temperature dependence of the absorption of the longitudinal sound.},

We propose a model that describes radiation of the EM field from superconductors with nonuniform pinning.

Highly anisotropic pressure dependences of the de Haas-van Alphen frequencies and cyclotron masses are observed in both compounds. Concurrently, ab initio calculations of the volume-dependent band structures are been carried out for these compounds, including the ferromagnetic- configuration phase of TmGa3, by employing a relativistic version of the full-potential linear muffin-tin orbital method within the local spin-density approximation. The experimental data are analyzed on the basis of the calculated volume-dependent band structures and compared with the corresponding pressure effects in the isostructural compound ErGa3.},

The superconducting transition is accompanied by catastrophically rapid vanishing of the electric potential, in sharp contrast to the theoretical estimates.},

Relative change of the RF absorption in magnetic field (magnetoabsorption) is about 67% in field 2.1 kOe and about 55% in field 1 kOe. This giant magnetoabsorption effect can be used to develop RF devices controlled by temperature and low magnetic field. A weak temperature dependence of magnetoabsorption for the sample studied in the range from room temperature to about 350 K makes it especially attractive for practical use. The RF study supplemented with transport, magnetoresistive and magnetic measurements enables us to discuss the optimal properties of manganite samples for observation of giant magnetoabsorption in low field.},

The position and structure of the peak in the average valence function are analogous to those studied previously in the aging systems Al-Mg and Al-Zn under suitable heat treatment. The value of the lithium impurity scattering parameter for the electron states in the vicinity of the point of degeneracy mentioned is estimated, and the linear relation of that parameter with impurity-related electrical resistance in aluminum alloys is established.},

Their propagation vectors are k1 = (0,0,1/2) and k2 = (1/2,0,1/2) in the Pnma crystal-structure unit cell. The intensities of the magnetic Bragg peaks are proportional to the squares of a modified Brillouin function for spin |. Its molecular field parameters depend on the reduced sublattice magnetizations σ as T N(1-eσ2). The fitting parameters are the Néel temperatures TN1 = 120 and TN2 = 123 K, and e1 = 0.2, e2 = 0.16 showing a weakening of the effective exchange. Below 27 K, an additional increase of the magnetic peak intensities is observed. Below ∼ 85K, the magnetic behavior is characteristic for a cluster glass. The uniaxial pressure effect on the DC-magnetization shows a sharp minimum near 120 K and it changes sign near 85 K, implying an alteration of the effective superexchange integral.},

Theoretical calculations in combination with experiments for the π* and σ* x-ray absorption edges are reported for the pure graphite and the graphite intercalation compound, LiC6. The anisotropy of the absorption spectra is due to the difference in the optical matrix elements for two different polarizations, which is a result of the anisotropic crystallographic and electronic properties of LiC6. Theory and experiment agree well for the π* and σ* resonances. By comparing calculations which include the effect of the core hole with similar calculations which do not, we conclude that 1s x-ray absorption in LiC 6 is partly associated with an excitonic effect. The electronic structure and optical absorption spectrum of LiMn2O4 spinel has been calculated and compared with available experimental data. The calculated absorption coefficient appeared to be in agreement with experiment, and the features of the absorption are associated with transitions between the exchange and crystal-field split t2g and eg d-bands of manganese in LiMn2O4 spinel.},

The resistance is measured by the Montgomery method for different combinations of directions of the transport current and magnetic field relative to the crystallographic axes. For the case when the field and transport current are directed parallel to the CuO2 layers, a transition from negative to positive magnetoresistance is observed when the temperature is raised to T≈20K. For fields perpendicular to the CuO2 layers, only negative magnetoresistance is observed. The nature of the positive magnetoresistance is discussed. It is shown that the effect is most likely due not to the interaction of the spin of the charge carriers with the surrounding magnetic medium but to the orbital motion of these carriers. The corresponding values of the positive magnetoresistance and its behavior as a function of magnetic field and temperature are found using the well-known model of Shklovskii and Efros, which is based on taking into account the compression of the impurity wave functions of the charge carriers in the magnetic field.},

In this connection, the magnetic properties of the hcp iron in an external magnetic field are very interesting and are studied here by employing an ab initio full-potential linear muffin tin orbital method. By this means the magnetic susceptibility Χ of hcp iron and its anisotropy energy for pressures and temperatures corresponding to the Earth's inner core conditions have been evaluated in the framework of the local spin density approximation. The accuracy of this method has been validated by calculating the anisotropic susceptibility of paramagnetic transition metals that form in the hcp crystal structure at ambient conditions. Our calculations demonstrate that for hcp iron the anisotropy of Χ is dependent on the c/a ratio. In conjunction with recent data on the c/a ratio and elastic constants of hcp iron, the magnetic anisotropy can explain the seismic anisotropy of the Earth's inner core.},

It was revealed that below the Curie point TC=314 K in addition to the main crystallographic phase possessing a rhombohedral structure R¯3c some amount of the orthorhombic Imma phase appears in the system. The system undergoes three magnetic phase transitions in low magnetic fields (of the second order at 300 and 250 K and of the first order at 177.5 K) and passes via a sharp but not complete structural transition R¯3c↔Imma in the vicinity of Te=200 K. The reduced change of magnetic susceptibility delta_X/X under uniaxial pressure displays a sharp minimum at temperature Te. Below the Curie temperature from 300 to 250 K the magnetic susceptibility X is independent of the temperature, which is considered as an indication of a probable formation below Th=300 K of a long period magnetic structure (probably a sort of low-angle helix).},

The surface potential is formed by two contributions, one of which is spatially periodic inside the sample, with the period of the acoustic field; the second is aperiodic and arises as a result of an additional nonuniformity of the electron distribution in a surface layer of the metal. In the nonlocal of parameters region the second contribution is dominant. The phases of these contributions are shifted by approximately π/2. For metals found in the normal state the experiment is in qualitative agreement with the theory. The superconducting transition is accompanied by catastrophically rapid vanishing of the electric potential, in sharp contrast to the theoretical estimates, which predict behavior similar to the BCS dependence of the attenuation coefficient for longitudinal sound.},

Temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility found represents a plateau, that is considered as an evidence of the formation of a long period magnetic structure (probably a sort of helix) below the Curie point. Pressure derivative of magnetization displays a sharp minimum at 200 K, pointing to an instability of electronic structure of the compound near this temperature.},

Measurements are made on a sample with a demagnetizing factor N=5.4 in static magnetic fields H in the range 0-120 Oe and on a toroidal sample with N=0 in fields with frequencies of 120 and 1000 Hz and amplitudes from 8×10-3 to 4.1 Oe. The effect of a uniaxial pressure P=0.1kbar on the static susceptibility χN=MN/H is investigated in the region 5K&lt;T&lt;270K. It is found that in the magnetically ordered state (below 314 K) χac is independent of the field amplitude in the interval 1.5-4.1 Oe and independent of temperature between 250 and 302 K. At a temperature Tp=250K a second-order phase transition (discontinuity of the derivative ∂χac/∂T) is observed, and at T i=177.5K - a first-order phase transition (discontinuity of χac(T)). The uniaxial pressure leads to an anomalous lowering of the susceptibility in the region 160-250 K with a sharp minimum at 200 K. The temperature and field dependence of the magnetic susceptibility outside the phase transition region are interpreted in terms of ideas about the formation of a helicoidal magnetic structure in the system in low fields at a temperature below 302 K.},

The electronic structure, total energies, open-circuit voltage, and magnetic moments were obtained for various spin configurations of LixdMn2O4 in the cubic spinel structure and the low-temperature orthorhombic structure. The effect of magnetic ordering on the band structure and structural stability has been investigated and an antiferromagnetic ordering proved to be the ground state of the LixMn2O4 spinels. Our calculations show that the manganese majority t2g d band is filled for all LixMn2O4 compounds studied, and the filling of the minority t2g band is expected in the lithiation process. The lithium intercalation potential, bulk modulus, magnetic moments, and optical properties are calculated within the itinerant band approach and are found to be in good agreement with available experimental data, indicating, that the density-functional theory provides reliable electronic structure of the LixMn2O4 system. The effect of the orthorhombic distortion on electronic structure and magnetism of LiMn2O4 was investigated, and our calculations do not show a substantial charge ordering at the structural transition from the cubic spinel to the orthorhombic structure, as proposed earlier. Instead, the low-temperature orthorhombic structure is found to possess the lowest energy via a Jahn-Teller distortion driven by the d band.},

The dependence is found to be nonmonotonic - as the temperature is decreased below the Néel temperature TN, the ferromagnetic moment initially increases and then decreases markedly. It reaches its highest value, close to 0.12 G, at a temperature of around 10.5 K, which is roughly TN/2. The possible mechanisms for the appearance of weak ferromagnetism in LiCoPO4 and the causes of the nonmonotonic temperature dependence of the spontaneous magnetic moment are discussed. Among the possible mechanisms, there is a preference for one in which the weak ferromagnetism is due to a nonuniform antiferromagnetic structure which is proposed for this crystal.},

In order to analyze the experimental magnetovolume effect, d ln χ/d ln V, the volume-dependent electronic structure of CeCo2 has been calculated ab initio by employing a relativistic full-potential LMTO method. The calculations have brought out strong hybridization of the itinerant 4f (Ce) and 3d (Co) states, which leads to a filling of the peculiar bonding band. It is demonstrated that the magnetic properties of CeCo2 are consistent with itinerant behavior of the 4f electrons of cerium. The large volume derivative of the effective electron-electron interaction parameter, d ln I/d ln V ≃ - 1.7, implies a predominant role of the short-range correlations, in accordance with the Hubbard model.},

The magnetic moments are oriented perpendicular to the chain direction. The temperature dependence of the electric resistivity reveals semiconducting behavior for both compounds. However, high-temperature susceptibility and ESR measurements strongly suggest a one-dimensional metallic character.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently several compounds were observed to reveal properties of a one-dimensional spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain with gapless low-lying spin excitations in an absence of an external magnetic field. However even a very weak external magnetic field yields an onset of a spin gap for those low-lying excitations. Usually this onset of a field-induced spin gap is related to the presence of a staggered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, or to the staggered effective g factors of magnetic ions. Experiments on thermodynamic properties cannot distinguish between those two origins for the spin-gap formation. Here we propose the setup for an experiment, in which one can clearly distinguish between the staggered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya coupling and staggered external magnetic field: an electronic paramagnetic resonance in the parallel pumping geometry. The characteristics of the system under conditions of such an experiment, i.e., the renormalization of the homogeneous and staggered magnetizations, power of the microwave magnetic field, absorbed by the system, are calculated. Several important features of the solution are discussed.},

The basis functions look rather simple in the coherent state representation and are expressed in terms of the degenerate hypergeometric function with respect to the complex variable labelling the representation. In some particular degenerate cases they turn (up to the power factor) into trigonometric or hyperbolic functions, Bessel functions or combinations of the exponent and Hermite polynomials. We find explicitly the relationship between coefficients at different powers of Bose operators that ensure quasi-exact solvability of Hamiltonians.},

In order to analyze these data, the volume dependent band structures of UX3 have been calculated ab initio in the paramagnetic phase by employing a relativistic full-potential LMTO method. The effect of external magnetic field was included self-consistently by means of the Zeeman operator, as well as including the orbital polarization. The calculations have brought out a predominance of itinerant uranium 5f states at the Fermi energy, as well as competition of the orbital and spin contributions to χ.

  Abstract                 = {The crossing of the temperature dependencies of sound velocity in the normal and the superconducting state of metallic glasses indicates renormalization of the intensity of sound interaction with two-level systems (TLS's) caused by their coupling with electrons. In this paper we examine different theoretical approaches to a quantitative description of the renormalization, using the results of a low-temperature ultrasonic investigation of Zr41.2Ti13.8Cu12.5Ni10Be 22.5 amorphous alloy. It is shown that the adiabatic renormalization of the coherent tunneling amplitude can explain only part of the whole effect observed in the experiment. There exists another mechanism of the renormalization affecting only nearly symmetric TLS's, which may be associated with the effect of electron density fluctuations on the interwell potential.},

The corresponding results do not exploit perturbation theory and include the strong-coupling regime.

The change in the sound velocities in an external magnetic field gives the first direct proof of the presence of an interaction between the magnetic and elastic subsystems of a virtual ferroelastic.

Low temperature anomalies of magnetic susceptibility, as well as substantial differences in the effects of stresses on the low field magnetic characteristics of alloys with various boron contents, have been revealed. The eutectic alloy Fe83B17 was found to be the least sensitive to applied stresses, magnetic fields, and temperature changes: it possesses the lowest magnetic induction in the reversibility fields region and the highest local anisotropy fluctuations. The hypoeutectic Fe84B16 alloy is the most sensitive to applied stresses at room temperature, but its sensitivity substantially reduces with increasing load, as well as with decreasing temperature. The results obtained reflect the special character of the alloys electronic structure at the eutectic point.},

For YbInCu4, which exhibits a first-order valence phase transition at TV ≃ 40 K, the Grüneisen parameter for the Kondo energy, ΩK ≡ -d ln TK/d ln V = -32, is large and typical for Ce-based heavy-fermion systems in magnitude but opposite in sign. The effect of atomic disorder is discussed on the basis of the data for a chemically disordered sample; the pressure effect at T = 78 K is strongly enhanced due to the spatial dispersion of pressure-sensitive TV, and hence dTV/dP = -2.0 K kbar-1 is obtained by assuming a Gaussian distribution of TV. On the basis of an extrapolation of the experimental pressure dependence, a (P, T) phase diagram is proposed for YbInCu4. Reference compounds with stable f moments, GdInCu4 and ErInCu4, show negligible pressure dependences of the susceptibility.},

The behavior of the main parameters of the system masked by blurring of the magnetic susceptibility singularity for a disordered sample during phase transition.

  Abstract                 = {The unusual non-linear effects in hopping conduction of single-crystal La2CuO4+δ with excess oxygen has been observed. The resistance is measured as a function of the applied voltage U (voltage controlled regime) in the temperature range 5 K≤T≤300 K and voltage range 10-3 - 25 V. At relatively high voltage (approximately at U&gt;0.1 V) the conduction of sample investigated corresponds well to variable-range hopping (VRH). That is, in the range 0.1 V &lt; U ≤ 1 V the conductivity does not depend on U (Ohmic behavior) and the temperature dependence of resistance R(T) follows closely Mott's law of VRH [R∝exp(T0/T)1/4]. In the range of highest applied voltage the conduction has been non-Ohmic: the resistance decreases with increasing U. This non-linear effect is quite expected in the frame of VRH mechanism, since the applied electric field increases the hopping probability. A completely different and unusual conduction behavior is found, however, in the low voltage range (approximately below 0.1 V), where the influence of electric field and (or) electron heating effect on VRH ought to be neglected. Here we have observed strong increase in resistance at increasing U at T ≤20 K, whereas at T&gt;20 K the resistance decreases with increasing U. The magnetoresistance of the sample below 20 K has been positive at low voltage and negative at high voltage. The observed unusual non-Ohmic behavior at low voltage range is attributable to inhomogeneity of the sample, namely, to the enrichment of sample surface with oxygen during the course of the heat treatment of the sample in helium and air atmosphere before measurements. At low enough temperature (below ≈20 K) the surface layer with increased oxygen concentration is presumed to consist of disconnected superconducting regions in a poorly conducting (dielectric) matrix. This allows us to explain the observed unusual non-linear effects in the conduction of sample studied. The results obtained demonstrate that in some cases the measured transport properties of cuprate oxides cannot be attributed to the intrinsic bulk properties.},

Moreover, the last contribution reveals a negligible pressure dependence for the reference GdInCu4 compound. For the YbInCu4 compound at T = 78 K, the pressure effect is significantly enhanced and is explained, in line with the temperature dependence of the susceptibility itself near the transition temperature Tv, in terms of spatial dispersion of its pressure dependence due to some atomic disorder.},

In order to analyze the experimental magnetovolume effect, to be specific dln x/dln V, the volume dependent electronic structure of UGa3 has been calculated ab initio in the paramagnetic phase by employing a relativistic full-potential LMTO method. The effect of the external magnetic field was included self-consistently by means of the Zeeman operator, as well as orbital polarization. The calculations have brought out a predominance of itinerant uranium 5f states at the Fermi energy, as well as large and competing orbital and spin contributions to x.

  Abstract                 = {The hopping conductivity of La2CuO4+δ single crystal with excess oxygen has been studied. It is found that the transition from variable-range hopping (with the temperature dependence of resistance R ∝ exp(T0/T)1/4) to simple activation conductivity (R ∝ exp(Δ/kT)) occurs at a temperature lower than 20 K. This transition is accompanied with significant changes in the behavior of magnetoresistance and current-voltage characteristics. It is shown that such a behavior of hopping conductivity below 20 K is due to the presence of superconducting inclusions in insulating sample due to phase separation of La2CuO4+δ. The observed peculiarities in the conducting properties are in good agreement with the known effects of competition between electron localization and superconductivity in homogeneous systems.},

  Abstract                 = {The magnetic susceptibility of ferromagnetic GdM alloys (M = Cu1-xGax, Mg, Zn) has been investigated under helium gas pressure for temperatures above TC. The evaluated pressure derivatives of the paramagnetic Curie temperature, d In Θ/dP, appeared to be remarkably different for isovalent GdMg and GdZn compounds (-11.2 Mbar-1 and -0.1 Mbar-1 respectively). Analysis of the obtained d In Θ/dP values for GdCu1-xGax alloys and results of ab initio electronic structure calculations have revealed the essential role of 5d electrons as the mediators of exchange coupling in ferromagnetic GdM compounds. The pressure derivatives of TC were calculated in the frameworks of modern mean-field theories by using volume-dependent band and exchange parameters, and including spin fluctuations effects. As a result, good agreement is found with the experimental values of d In Θ/dP.},

Rotating q from the [100] or [110] to the [001] direction we registered, first, a strong lowering, and, then, a steplike increase of v=. The observed features can be described by a phenomenological model, based on the suggestion about the existence of a sound like collective mode coupled to uzz lattice deformation.

It was discovered that in Al the electron-electron scattering yields the main contribution (~T2) in ES attenuation. In contrast to Ga and Mo, ES amplitude in the superconducting state of Al increases sharply just below Tc. The ES in Al represents most likely the sum of two signals of different nature - Fermi-liquid zero sound and ballistic quasiwaves.},

Rotating q from the [100] to the [001] direction we registered, first, a strong lowering, and, then, a steplike increase (up to two times) of vt. There is no reasonable explanation of the observed peculiarities in the framework of conventional elasticity theory and the effect can be accounted for by the existence of a two-dimensional soundlike collective mode of electronic origin that strongly interacts with lattice vibrations. A proposed phenomenological model of the effect is in qualitative agreement with the experimental data.},

  Abstract                 = {We develop a new method of investigation of low-temperature electron relaxation \in metals, based on the analysis of the temperature dependences of the attenuation of zero sound excited by ultrasonic pulses. We have discovered that these dependences obtained in the temperature region about of 1-8 K reproduce directly the temperature behavior of the electron scattering rate. The main features of our method are its insensitivity to small-angle scattering and the additivity of contributions of various relaxation processes to the total scattering rate. Both the theoretical analysis of zero-sound propagation in various damping regimes and special experiments produced for gallium confirm the validity of our consideration. We have identified the considerable contribution of electron-electron collisions in all investigated metals (gallium, aluminum, molybdenum, and tungsten) in the whole studied temperature interval and established the dominating role of Umklapp processes in the zero-sound damping at T >- 4 K for gallium and most probably for tungsten. We interpret the latter result as the first experimental observation of Peierls' exponent in polyvalent metals in zero magnetic field. The values obtained for electron-electron and electron-phonon scattering rates are compared with known experimental data and theoretical estimations.},

The electron energy spectra are calculated using the method of pseudopotential. A detailed structure of the electron density of states and the Fermi surface of Cd3Mg and Mg3Cd is found. It is shown that the one-electron component of the total energy of the crystal predominates in the stabilization of the ordered state at low temperature. The calculated Fermi surface characteristics of the ordered compound Cd3Mg are compared with experimental result on the de Haas - van Alphen effect and a new interpretation of the frequency oscillations observed experimentally is proposed.},

The experimental temperature dependences of the amplitude and the phase velocity of these signals have been studied in the normal and superconducting state. They interpret this effect observed earlier in Ga by Burma et al. as the excitation of a weakly damped zero-sound wave caused by the Fermi-liquid interaction between charge carriers. A dominating role of the electron-electron collisions in the zero-sound damping in Mo was established, and the corresponding relaxation time was estimated. Theoretical calculations of the expected zero-sound behaviour in a superconductor are in good agreement with the experimental data and enable them to determine the intensity of the Fermi-liquid interaction.},

The calculations reveal that the collinear antiferromagnetic structure-in contrast to a non-collinear one-has the lowest total energy and seems the most preferable candidate for the low-temperature ground-state phase of FeGe2 in agreement with recent neutron diffraction experiments. The calculated Fermi surface cross-sections and cyclotron masses are in good agreement with the DHVA experimental data. From the DHVA and heat capacity data together with the results of band structure calculations the average value of the electron-phonon interaction constant lambda equivalent to 0.5 has been deduced for FeGe 2. For the alternative non-collinear model the authors obtained a higher value of the total energy and poor agreement with the DHVA experiment.},

  Abstract                 = {The temperature dependences of electrical resistivity, thermoelectric power, magnetic susceptibility, thermal expansion coefficient, upper and lower critical fields, and critical currents in single crystals of Y1Ba2Cu3O(x) (x = 6, 9) and the temperature dependences of the Young modulus and internal friction in melt samples of Y1Ba2Cu3O(x) were measured. The results obtained show that Y1Ba2CuO3 undergoes a phase transition at 50, 150, and 220 K which influences both electron and lattice characteristics. The observed temperature dependences of electrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility indicate the fluctuation of carriers above the critical temperature. The measured results are in good agreement with Aslamazov-Larkin theory.},

The experimental results suggest that a martensite-type phase transition occurs in the temperature region of 200 to 230 K. It is shown that the elastic properties and the thermal expansion coefficient of the ceramic samples are controlled by thermal activation processes. Fluctuation contribution to electrical conductivity and magretic susceptibility are estimated by temperature dependences of both electrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility anisotropy of the single crystals.},

A comparison with experimental g-factor data makes it possible to estimate the exchange-correlation enhancement factor for electrons on the Fermi surface of copper. The Fermi-surface average of the enhancement factor is in agreement with the predictions of a first-principles calculation, and the data suggest a weak anisotropy. Experimental data for silver and gold prove to be insufficiently accurate to yield reliable values of the exchange-correlation enhancement factor.

  Abstract                 = {The pressure effect on the magnetic susceptibility of electrons in metals of the sp-, d- and f-type is briefly discussed. The experimentally studied dependences of band spectrum and electron interaction parameters on the atomic volume are presented. The Hubbard model is found to be much better than the local density-functional approximation when describing the exchange-correlation enhancement behaviour of spin paramagnetism in d-metals. A probable cause of the observed paramagnetic moment sensitivity to pressure in the stable f-states of heavy rare-earth metals is considered.},

Two types of AF spiral structure of different symmetry are found. The transverse AF spiral phase exists in comparatively small magnetic fields, H<HpHe(aoqc)2 (He is the exchange field, qc the spiral wave vector, and ao the lattice constant), while the longitudinal AF spiral phase exists in stronger magnetic fields up to HtHeaoqc. The phase transition between these two AF spiral structures in the field-temperature phase diagram is first order. The temperature dependence of the wave vector of the spiral structure in the absence of magnetic field is also determined, and the results of magnetostriction experiments are explained.},

The nature of the MPE consists in intensification of heat activated dislocation processes in a magnetized ferromagnetic owing not only to the effective stresses near stopped dislocations increased by domain walls, as previously suggested, but also generation of the heat of hysteresis during Barkhausen discontinuities and the appearance of Joule heat of eddy currents by the walls.},

The results obtained and supplemented with data derived by other methods show a strong temperature dependence of the magnetovolume effect in palladium and the alloy and its invariance in vanadium. The low temperature data for pure metals are compared with theoretical calculation, which shows an appreciable discrepancy whose origin is not clear.},

The saturation magnetostriction and the characteristic field required to produce saturation decrease with increasing temperature and approach zero at the lower transition temperature, TK {reversed tilde equals} 265 K.

  Abstract                 = {De Haas-van Alphen oscillations are observed in the ordered intermetallic compound Cd3Mg at 1.5 to 4.2 K in the field up to 70 kG. The angular dependence of frequency oscillations in the range of 2.1 to 6.0 MG is studied. Effective masses of carriers and the Dingle temperature are measUred for some characteristic orientations of the magnetic field With respect to the crystal axes. The band structure of Cd3Mg is calculated on the basis of the model Animalu-Heine pseudopotentials. The model Fermi surface of Cd3Mg, is constructed and the interpretation of the oscillations observed experimentally is proposed.},

The shape magnetostriction remained constant and roughly equal to the large value observed in Pd. This strong anisotropy of the magnetostriction is therefore not due to the stress-dependent anisotropy of the exchange-enhanced spin susceptibility, and is more likely to result from the stress-independent anisotropy of the spin-orbit interaction.},

A possibility arises to study thermal effects at low-temperature plastic deformation of shown materials due to extremal temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility. The increase of sample temperature at ΔT approximately 0.2 K is shown in the process of plastic deformation at the rate of 0.5 mm/min at 4.2 K.

  Abstract                 = {The previously developed theory of magnetism of simple hcp metals is employed to analyze magnetic susceptibility of pure cadmium crystals containing homovalent impurities under pressure at low (T=20 K) temperatures. The effect of impurity scattering on the magnetic susceptibility is taken into account in terms of an ''effective temperature'' determined from measutements. By comparing experimental and theoretical values of the magnetic susceptibility we have determined some of the energy-spectrum parameters of pure cadmium, as well as band splittings and the relative position of the Fermi level -as functions of the concentration of magnesium and mercury impurities and the pressure. Quantitative characteristics of the cadmium pseudopotential near the first form factor's zero is also determined in the ''on-Fermi-sphere'' approximation.},

It is stated that the constant magnetic field of 2.71 × 103 Am-1 does not influence the tensile properties and plastic deformation of steels, but the transient magnetic fields lead to changes in deforming stress.

The temperature-induced changes of the parameters of the beryllium spectrum near the band degeneracy point and the corresponding dependences of the susceptibility on the chemical-potential levels are calculated for various temperatures in a model with a nonlocal psuedopotential and an isotropic Debye-Waller factor.

  Abstract                 = {An expression for the spin contribution to the magnetic susceptibility anisotropy of holes in tellurium is derived. The total hole susceptibility anisotropy including spin and orbital terms is calculated with scattering taken into account. The complete quantitative description of the experimental data for hole concentrations of 3.5 × 1016 ≦ n &lt; 3.5 × 1018 cm−3 and T = 4.2 K is obtained by means of selection and more precise definition of the spectrum parameters which determine the spin contribution. The discrepancy between calculated and experimental temperature dependences of the hole magnetic susceptibility anisotropy at temperatures above 60 K appears to be due to the thermal variation of the spectrum parameters.},

It has been established that a constant magnetic field H = 34 kOe increases the flow limit of nickel by about 10% while transient magnetic fields cause a change in the deforming stress. It is concluded that the observed effects can be explained by magnetostriction and Joule heating of the nickel samples by Eddy currents.},

The relative shifts of the density of states of different symmetry at the Fermi level is apparently less than for d-metals of the same valency. However, due to the sharpness of the peak at the change in the density of states, this mechanism proves to be less effective than simple band broadening. The parameters found may be of interest, not only for correcting the lattice potential, but also in ascertaining the role of the band structure in the superconductive properties of A-15 compounds, and also for analysing the reasons for the spectral diffuseness in solid solutions of these compounds.},

  Abstract                 = {Employing the de Haas‐van Alphen effect, the behaviour of small cross‐sections of the Permi surface under pressure has been studied on Mo, W, and Re. The results are discussed in terms of a simple empirical model for spectrum changes under pressure. The model also involves the deformation of d‐band and its shift relative t o the s·p band. The possibility is shown of obtaining quantitative information on the behaviour under pressure of the fundamental parameters of the transition metal energy spectra on the basis of studying small cross‐sections of the Fermi surface.},
