<h3>Main results</h3>
<br>
<ul>


<li>Magnetic properties of new multiferroic BiFe<sub>0.5</sub>Sc<sub>0.5</sub>O<sub>3</sub> perovskite was studied 
in magnetic fields up to 50 kOe in the temperature range of 5–300 K. 
The compound shows a weak ferromagnetic component below the Néel temperature, T<sub>N</sub>∼220 K. 
A wide cusp-like anomaly of the temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility was revealed below 200 K. 
The anomaly is dependent on the magnetic field applied and can be associated with 
the glassy magnetic behavior of the compound.</li>

<li>Magnetic properties of polycrystalline multiferroic Bi<sub>0.65</sub>La<sub>0.35</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>Sc<sub>0.5</sub>O<sub>3</sub> were studied 
over the temperature range of 5−300 K in magnetic fields up to H=50 kOe. 
Derivative of the initial magnetization curves demonstrates a temperature-dependent anomaly 
in fields of H=15−25 kOe. Also, an anomaly of the temperature dependent magnetization 
measured in ZFC regime in magnetic fields of 6−7 kOe has been found. 
Origin of both anomalies is associated with inhomogeneous magnetic state of the compound.</li>

<li>Magnetic behavior of Co<sup>II</sup>(n)Al<sup>III</sup> layered double hydroxides (LDHs) (n = Co/Al = 2 and 3) 
intercalated with nitrate was studied as a function of temperature. 
Co(2)Al–NO<sub>3</sub> and Co(3)Al–NO<sub>3</sub> demonstrate anomalous behavior of their temperature dependence 
magnetic susceptibility in a higher temperature range: between 75 and 175 K, 
both the paramagnetic Curie temperature and the effective magnetic moment change in a non-monotonous way.</li>

<li>Exchange bias phenomenon, evident of antiferromagnetic–ferromagnetic phase segregation state, 
has been observed in (Nd<sub>1-x</sub>Y<sub>x</sub>)<sub>2/3</sub>Ca<sub>1/3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> (x = 0, 0.1) compounds at low temperatures. 
A contribution to the total magnetization of the compounds due to the ferromagnetic phase has been evaluated. 
It has been found that yttrium doping leads to the growth of the ferromagnetic phase fraction.</li>

<li>The magnetization of FeSe<sub>1-x</sub>Te<sub>x</sub> (x = 0, 0.5, and 1.0) compounds has been studied 
in magnetic fields up to 50 kOe and at temperatures of 2 - 300 K. 
The superconducting transition was observed at T<sub>c</sub> ~ 8 K and 13.6 - 14.2 K in FeSe<sub>0.963</sub> and FeSe<sub>0.5</sub>Te<sub>0.5</sub>, 
respectively. The intrinsic magnetic susceptibility of FeSe<sub>0.963</sub>, FeSe<sub>0.5</sub>Te<sub>0.5</sub>, and FeTe was estimated 
to increase gradually with Te content. For FeTe a drastic drop in χ(T) with decreasing temperature 
was found at T<sub>N</sub> ~ 70 K, which is presumably related to antiferromagnetic ordering.</li>

<li>A detailed magnetization study for the novel FeSe superconductor is carried out to investigate 
the behavior of the intrinsic magnetic susceptibility χ in the normal state with temperature 
and under hydrostatic pressure. The temperature dependences of χ and its anisotropy are measured 
for FeSe single crystals in the temperature range 4.2-300 K, and a substantial growth of susceptibility 
with temperature is revealed.</li>

<li>The magnetic susceptibility of the compound LaFeAsO<sub>0.85</sub>F<sub>0.1</sub> was investigated in the temperature 
range 4.2 - 300 K, and the superconducting transition was detected at 26 K. 
A clear cusp at T<sub>M</sub> ~ 135 K was observed in the low-field dependence of the magnetic susceptibility χ(T) 
with a sharp rise of χ with further cooling to TC ~ 26 K. 
The obtained magnetization data M(H) indicate the emergence of an FM phase at T≤T<sub>M</sub>.</li>

<li>The temperature dependencies of the magnetic susceptibility χ and its anisotropy were measured 
for the hexagonal single crystalline TB<sub>2</sub> compounds (T = Sc, Ti, Zr, Hf, V and Cr) 
in the temperature range 4.2-300 K. It was found that χ varies strongly and nonmonotonously 
with the filling of the hybridized <i>d-</i>band, being almost temperature independent 
and the largest for the diborides of group 4 metals.</li>

<li>Magnetic properties of multi-walled carbon nanotubes modified with iron MWCNT+Fe are studied in detail 
in the temperature range 4.2-300 K. The ZFC and FC temperature dependences of the magnetic susceptibility 
reveal a number of magnetic phase transitions in this Fe-MWCNT system, 
including a Verwey transition in Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> particles which are presumably outside the MWCNT. 
It has been shown that both the residual magnetization M<sub>R</sub> and the coercive field H<sub>c</sub> 
decrease monotonically with increasing temperature.</li>

<li>The magnetic properties of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) modified with cobalt nanoparticles 
were studied in the temperatures and magnetic field range of (4.2-290) K and (0.3–50) kOe, respectively. 
Magnetization studies revealed two principal groups of Co nanoclusters in the synthesized MWCNT/Co sample. 
The larger particles have a size from a few to about 10 nm. They are ferromagnetic, at least up to 300 K, 
with the coercive field of about 600 Oe. The smaller Co particles have the atomic-scale size. 
They are responsible for a pronounced paramagnetic behavior observed at low temperatures.
The magnetic characterization provided the remanent magnetization value (M<sub>R</sub>) of about 0.07 emu/g 
(40% of the saturation moment), while the coercive field (H<sub>c</sub>) value amounts to 600 Oe. 
Both parameters M<sub>R</sub> and H<sub>c</sub> slightly decrease with the rise of temperature. 
The substantial magnetization increase observed at low temperatures suggests the existence 
of nano Co clusters (in the atomic scale size).</li>

<li>In the region of the equilibrium solid solutions of lithium in aluminum an anomalous 
low-temperature peak of diamagnetism is observed which is due to the presence 
of a boundary point on a line of band degeneracy directly below the Fermi level.</li>


</ul>
<br>
<br>



<h3>Experimental equipment</h3>
<br>
<ul>


<li>SQUID-magnetometer (self-made) for measuring magnetic susceptibility and magnetization of solids 
in magnetic fields up to 50 kOe at temperatures of 4.2 ÷ 320 K 
with the possibility of studying the influence of uniaxial compression.</li>

<li>A magnetometer for measuring the <i>ac</i>-susceptibility in weak magnetic fields at temperatures<br> 
of 78 ÷ 350 K in the frequency range 1 ÷ 200 kHz is being developed.</li>
