  Abstract                 = {Pressure effect on the magnetic susceptibility of YbInCu4 and GdInCu4 compounds has been studied at fixed temperatures of 78, 150 and 300 K under helium gas pressure up to 2 kbar. The data for the YbInCu4 compound at T ≥ 100 K are well described in terms of the characteristic Kondo temperature change dTk/dlnV= --- 640 K, which is typical for other Kondo systems and far exceeds the corresponding derivative values for usual mechanisms of the indirect f --- f interaction. Moreover, the last contribution reveals a negligible pressure dependence for the reference GdInCu4 compound. For the YbInCu4 compound at T = 78 K, the pressure effect is significantly enhanced and is explained, in line with the temperature dependence of the susceptibility itself near the transition temperature Tv, in terms of spatial dispersion of its pressure dependence due to some atomic disorder.},

Supposing the value of d ln I/d In V = - 2.8, which was found in DyIn3, the same in both compounds, the derivatives with respect to volume d ln DELTA/d ln V = - 6.7 and d ln chi(d)d/d In Y = 1.9 in SmIn3 are obtained. The scale of d-band contribution chi(d) into SmIn3 susceptibility is close to one in DyIn3.},

The experimental results suggest that a martensite-type phase transition occurs in the temperature region of 200 to 230 K. It is shown that the elastic properties and the thermal expansion coefficient of the ceramic samples are controlled by thermal activation processes. Fluctuation contribution to electrical conductivity and magretic susceptibility are estimated by temperature dependences of both electrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility anisotropy of the single crystals.},

magnitude of the magnetovolumetric effect is investigated as a function of concentration and temperature using simple empirical models of the change in the electron spectrum under pressure and due to alloying within the framework of the band approach, and estimates of the volume integrals are obtained for the primary spectral parameters and the effective exchange interaction I. The quantity d In I/d In V = - 0.7 + 0.2 differs substantially from the theoretical data for palladium, which suggests a weaker volumetric dependence of I.},

  Abstract                 = {The magnetic susceptibility of ternary alloys of palladium with rhodium and silver was measured at room temperature and under hydrostatic pressures up to 4000 atm. The effect of pressure on the structure of the spectrum and the effect of the electron scattering in the alloys are considered within the frameworks of simple models. An analysis of the experimental results for the ternary alloys and for the previously investigated binary alloys yields the parameters that describe the scattering, as well as the dependence of the density of the electronic states at the Fermi level and of the exchange enhancement of spin paramagnetism on the atomic volume.},
