  Abstract                 = {We have investigated the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility χ(T) of rare-earth cobaltites RCoO<sub>3</sub> (R = La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu) in the temperature range 4.2-300 K and also the influence of hydrostatic pressure up to 2 kbar on their susceptibility at fixed temperatures T = 78 and 300 K. The specific dependence χ(T) observed in LaCoO<sub>3</sub> and the anomalously large pressure effect (dlnχ/dP ∼ -100 Mbar<sup>-1</sup> for T = 78 K) are analyzed in the framework of a two-level model with energy levels difference Δ. The ground state of the system is assumed to be nonmagnetic with the zero spin of Co<sup>3+</sup> ions, and magnetism at a finite temperature is determined by the excited magnetic spin state. The results of the analysis, supplemented by theoretical calculations of the electronic structure of LaCoO<sub>3</sub>, indicate a significant increase in Δ with a decrease in the unit cell volume under the hydrostatic pressure. In the series of RCoO<sub>3</sub> (R = Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu) compounds, the volume of crystal cell decreases monotonically due to a decrease in the radius of R<sup>3+</sup> ions. This leads to an increase in the relative energy Δ of the excited state (the chemical pressure effect), which manifests itself in a decrease in the contribution of cobalt ions to the magnetic susceptibility at a fixed temperature, and also in a decrease in the hydrostatic pressure effect on the susceptibility of RCoO<sub>3</sub> compounds, which we have observed at T = 300 K.},

  Abstract                 = {The effect of pressure on magnetic properties of LaCoO3 is studied experimentally and theoretically. The pressure dependence of magnetic susceptibility χ of LaCoO3 is obtained by precise measurements of χ as a function of the hydrostatic pressure P up to 2 kbar in the temperature range from 78 K to 300 K. A pronounced magnitude of the pressure effect is found to be negative in sign and strongly temperature dependent. The obtained experimental data are analysed by using a two-level model and DFT+U calculations of the electronic structure of LaCoO3. In particular, the fixed spin moment method was employed to obtain a volume dependence of the total energy difference Δ between the low spin and the intermediate spin states of LaCoO3. Analysis of the obtained experimental χ(P) dependence within the two-level model, as well as our DFT+U calculations, have revealed the anomalous large decrease in the energy difference Δ with increasing of the unit cell volume. This effect, taking into account a thermal expansion, can be responsible for the temperatures dependence of Δ, predicting its vanishing near room temperature.},

The electronic states and interactions responsible for the superconducting and magnetic properties of these systems are analyzed. It is found that the Fermi level in the compounds YRh4B4 and LuRh4B4 is immediately adjacent to a peak in the density of electronic states and about 1 eV above a pseudogap in the electronic spectrum. The existence of a number of groups of quasi-degenerate electronic states with low effective masses near the Fermi level is revealed. These states may be the cause of a significant diamagnetic contribution of the conduction electrons to the magnetic susceptibility and may be responsible for the strong temperature dependence of the susceptibility in the rhodium borides.},

It is established that the nature of the chemical bonds is mainly metallic, and the presence of covalent bonds Fe-Te and Te-Te helps to stabilize the structural distortions of the tetragonal phase of FeTe in the low-temperature region. It is found that the bicollinear AFM structure corresponds to the ground state of the FeTe compound and the calculated value of the magnetic moment MFe = -2.4μB is in good agreement with the data from neutron diffraction measurements. At the same time, the Fermi surface (FS) of the low-temperature AFM phase is radically different from the FS of the paramagnetic FeTe. Reconstructing the FS can lead to a sign change of the Hall coefficient observed in FeTe. The calculation results serve as evidence of the fact that the electron structures and magnetic properties of FeTe are well-described by the model of itinerant d-electrons and the density functional theory (DFT-GGA).},

The magnetic properties of BiFeO<sub>3</sub> in the antiferromagnetic state and their dependences on hydrostatic pressure are studied experimentally and theoretically. These results indicate a substantial rise in the magnetic susceptibility χ of the compound under pressure with a characteristic pressure derivative dlnχ/dP ~ 3 × 10-2 GPa-1. A quantitative estimate of the magnetostriction is made on the basis of this value for the derivative and it is shown that a magnetostriction mechanism predominates in the interactions of the magnetic and electric subsystems of multiferroic BiFeO<sub>3</sub>.},

The concentration of strontium in the samples was 0.01, 0.005 and 0.001. In the temperature range T < 100K for all the samples the conduction mechanism corresponded to 3D variable-range hopping. For T > T<sub>N</sub> (where T<sub>N</sub> is the Neel temperature) a transition to the metallic type of conductivity was observed. Nonlinear effects in low-temperature conductivity, magnetoresistivity, as well as current-controlled negative differential resistance were found. It was established that the nonlinear behavior of conductivity intensified with decreasing the strontium concentration. For temperatures T < 10 K, the effect of positive magnetoresistance was observed. It is suggested that this effect can be attributed to the presence of a new low-- temperature magnetic phase (spin density waves).},

  Abstract                 = {The magnetic properties of Fe1+yTe single crystals (y≃ 0.10.18) were studied at temperatures 4.2300K. At an ambient pressure, with decreasing temperature a drastic drop in χ(T) was confirmed at T≃ 6065K, which appears to be closely related to the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering. It is found that the magnitudes of the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility Δχ in the AFM phase are close in the studied samples, whereas the sign of the anisotropy apparently depends on the small variations of the excess iron y in Fe1+yTe samples. The performed DFT calculations of the electronic structure and magnetic properties for the stoichiometric FeTe compound indicate the presence of frustrated AFM ground states. There are very close energies and magnetic moments for the double stripe configurations, with the AFM axes oriented either on the basal plane or along the [0 0 1] direction. Presumably, both these configurations can be realized in Fe1+yTe single crystals, depending on the variations of the excess iron. This can provide different signs of magnetic anisotropy in the AFM phase, presently observed in the Fe1+yTe samples. For these types of AFM configuration, the calculations for the FeTe values of Δχ are consistent with our experimental data.},

  Abstract                 = {A detailed magnetization study for the novel FeSe superconductor is carried out to investigate the behavior of the intrinsic magnetic susceptibility χ in the normal state with temperature and under hydrostatic pressure. The temperature dependences of χ and its anisotropy Δχ = χ- χ are measured for FeSe single crystals in the temperature range 4.2-300 K, and a substantial growth of susceptibility with temperature is revealed. The observed anisotropy Δχ is very large and comparable to the averaged susceptibility at low temperatures. For a polycrystalline sample of FeSe, the significant pressure effect on χ is determined to be essentially dependent on temperature. Ab initio calculations of the pressure-dependent electronic structure and magnetic susceptibility indicate that FeSe is close to magnetic instability, with dominating enhanced spin paramagnetism. The calculated paramagnetic susceptibility exhibits a strong dependence on the unit cell volume and especially on the height Z of chalcogen species from the Fe plane. The change of Z under pressure determines a large positive pressure effect on χ, which is observed at low temperatures. It is shown that the literature experimental data on the strong and nonmonotonic pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature in FeSe correlate qualitatively with the calculated behavior of the density of electronic states at the Fermi level.},

  Abstract                 = {The magnetic properties of nitrogen-doped multi-walled carbon nanotubes (N-MWCNTs) were studied in the temperature and magnetic field range of (4.2-290) K and (0.05-30) kOe, respectively. Also magnetic properties of the reference MWCNTs without nitrogen doping were investigated on the same footing for comparison. The presence of iron-based particles inside N-MWCNTs was detected. The low temperature SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) magnetization measurements were supplemented with thermogravimetric analysis. The magnetic characterization provided the saturation magnetic moment M S and residual magnetization MR of N-MWCNTs to be, respectively, 4.5 emu/g and 0.9 emu/g, whereas for the reference MWCNTs the corresponding parameters are found to be about twice higher. The coercive field value amounts to 800 Oe for both systems at low temperatures, then decreasing to about 450 Oe at 200 K.},

The dc paramagnetic susceptibility of Gd was measured in the temperature range 295-365 K and under hydrostatic pressure up to 0.16 GPa, yielding values of the paramagnetic Curie temperature Θ and its pressure derivative. Based on the results of ab initio electronic structure calculations, the experimental behavior of Θ under hydrostatic pressure together with the literature data on the uniform and uniaxial pressure effects was examined within a mean-field like approach. For this purpose, the effective d-band susceptibility and the relevant exchange integrals were calculated as functions of the lattice parameters within the density functional theory. These calculations provided a reasonable description of the experimentally observed uniform pressure effect, but a less satisfactory description of the uniaxial pressure effect.},

A substantial positive pressure effect on χ is detected at low temperatures for both compounds. At room temperature, this effect is found to be also strong, but it is negative for FeSe and positive for FeTe. Ab initio calculations of the pressure dependent electronic structure and magnetic susceptibility indicate that FeSe and FeTe are close to magnetic instability with dominating enhanced spin paramagnetism. The calculated paramagnetic susceptibility exhibits a strong dependence on the unit cell volume and the height Z of chalcogen species from the Fe plane. The observed large positive pressure effects on χ in FeTe and FeSe at low temperatures are related to considerable sensitivity of the paramagnetism to the internal parameter Z. It is shown that available experimental data on the strong and nonmonotonic pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature in FeSe correlate qualitatively with the calculated behavior of the density of electronic states at the Fermi level.},

The superconducting transition was observed at Tc∼8K and 13.6-14.2K in FeSe0.963 and FeSe0.5Te0.5, respectively. For most of the samples, nonlinearity of the magnetization curves in the normal state gives evidence of a common, substantial presence of ferromagnetic impurities in these compounds. By taking these impurity effects into account, the intrinsic magnetic susceptibility χ of FeSe0.963, FeSe0.5Te0.5, and FeTe was estimated to increase gradually with Te content. For FeTe a drastic drop in χ(T) with decreasing temperature was found at TN∼70K, which is presumably related to antiferromagnetic ordering. To shed light on the observed magnetic properties, ab initio calculations of the exchange enhanced magnetic susceptibility are performed for FeSe and FeTe in the local spin density approximation.},

Experimental data and "first principles" calculations of the electronic structure and paramagnetic contributions to the susceptibility indicate that YNi5, LaNi5, and CeNi5 are close to a quantum critical point. It is found that the van Vleck orbital contribution to the magnetic susceptibility is 15-20% in these exchange-enhanced paramagnetic materials and should be taken into account in analyzing experimental data on χ and dlnχ/dlnV. Calculations of the magnetic-field induced moments for atoms in the unit cell of YNi5 reveal an inhomogeneous distribution of the magnetization density and a nontrivial competition between the spin and orbital moments.},

The magnetic characterization provided the remanent magnetization value (MR) of about 0.07 emu/g (∼40% of the saturation moment), while the coercive field (HC) value amounts to 600 Oe.

One of the samples with δ ≲ 0.01, was fairly homogeneous in oxygen distribution (not phase-separated) with Néel temperature TN ≈ 266 K. Conductivity of this sample has been determined by Mott's variable-range hopping below TN. The other, far less resistive, sample with δ ≈ 0.05, was inhomogeneous (phase-separated) showing both PM-AFM (TN ≈ 205 K) and superconducting (Tc ≈ 25 K) transitions. It is found that for the homogeneous sample the resistivity decreases above TN far faster with temperature than below it (for both directions of measuring current, parallel and perpendicular to basal CuO2 planes). A similar behavior of conductivity near PM-AFM transition is also found for the phase-separated and less resistive sample. In this case a clear kink in R (T) curve near TN ≈ 205 K can be seen. Furthermore, a transition to metallic (dR / dT &gt; 0) behavior occurs far enough above TN. The observed behavior of the samples studied is related to increased delocalization of charge carriers above TN. This is in accordance with decrease in the AFM correlation length and corresponding enhancement of the hole mobility above TN known for low-doped lanthanum cuprates.},

Superconducting behavior was found below 26K, whereas a distinct peculiarity in the low-field dependence of the magnetic susceptibility χ(T) was clearly observed at TM≃135K, which resembles a weak ferromagnetic (FM) response with saturation magnetic moment of about 10-4μB per formula unit at 50K. The transition at TM is presumably not governed by magnetic impurities but rather correlated with the antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition in undoped LaFeAsO at about the same temperature. We suggest that the observed magnetic properties of the LaFeAsO0.85F0.1 sample are due to an interplay of FM and AFM transitions, and are presumably related with an intrinsic feature of a small portion of the undoped LaFeAsO phase inherent in our sample. In order to shed light on the problem of magnetic instability of the LaFeAsO, ab initio DFT calculations of the electronic structure and paramagnetic susceptibility were performed within the local spin density approximation. It is shown that a V-shaped peculiarity in the density of electronic states close to the Fermi level can govern magnetic properties of LaFeAsO with fluorine doping and/or oxygen deficiency.},

  Abstract                 = {Pressure effects on electronic structure and magnetic properties of iron-based superconductors FeSe1-xTex (x ~ 0, 0.5 and 1.0) and LaFeAsO are investigated. The superconducting transition was observed at TC ~ 8, 13.6-14.2, and 26 K in FeSe0.963, FeSe0.5Te0.5, and LaFeAsO0.85F0.1, respectively. The intrinsic magnetic susceptibility χ in the series of FeSe0.963, FeSe0.5Te0.5 and FeTe is found to increase gradually approximately 10 times as much with Te content. A kink in the low-field dependence of χ(T) was detected at TM ~ 135 K for LaFeAsO0.85F0.1. The electronic structures and paramagnetic susceptibilities of the studied compounds are calculated ab initio in external magnetic field as a function of atomic volume and structural parameter Z, which specifies the relative height of chalcogen atoms above iron plane. The calculated field-induced magnetic moments and their volume derivatives indicate that these systems are in a close proximity to a
quantum critical point. For FeSe and FeTe the calculated paramagnetic susceptibilities reveal a large magnetovolume effect and a drastic sensitivity to parameter Z.},

  Abstract                 = {The ultrasonic properties of La1-x Cax Mn O3 (x≈0.25) with the Curie temperature TC about 200 K are studied. Temperature dependences of longitudinal and transverse sound velocities were measured in zero magnetic field and for different constant magnetic fields as well. The ultrasonic study is supported by magnetic, resistive, magnetoresistive, structural, and other measurements of the sample that facilitate interpretation of the results obtained. The magnetic-field influence on sound properties found in this study presents some interesting features of the interplay between the elastic and magnetic properties of these compounds. It is shown that the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition in the sample studied is first order, but can become second order under the influence of applied magnetic field.},

Our results show that the decrease of the unit cell volume under pressure is followed by decrease of Θ (≈TC). As it was evaluated from X-ray study, the substitution of U by Th leads to a nearly linear increase of the unit cell volume V, i.e. to negative chemical pressure effect. The chemical pressure effect appears to be of the same order as the total change of TC induced by hydrostatic pressure in these alloys but opposite in sign. The decrease of TC with alloying is presumably caused by a change of 5f state hybridization with conduction electrons.},

The Curie temperature, T c, of the sample is about 374 K. Giant temperature and magnetic-field variations in RF absorption are found in the vicinity of Tc. Relative change of the RF absorption in magnetic field (magnetoabsorption) is about 67% in field 2.1 kOe and about 55% in field 1 kOe. This giant magnetoabsorption effect can be used to develop RF devices controlled by temperature and low magnetic field. A weak temperature dependence of magnetoabsorption for the sample studied in the range from room temperature to about 350 K makes it especially attractive for practical use. The RF study supplemented with transport, magnetoresistive and magnetic measurements enables us to discuss the optimal properties of manganite samples for observation of giant magnetoabsorption in low field.},

  Abstract                 = {The anisotropy of the hopping conductivity of antiferromagnetic La 2CuO4+δ single crystals with TN≈188K is investigated in the temperature range 5-295 K and the anisotropy of their magnetoresistance, in the temperature range 5-55 K. The resistance is measured by the Montgomery method for different combinations of directions of the transport current and magnetic field relative to the crystallographic axes. For the case when the field and transport current are directed parallel to the CuO2 layers, a transition from negative to positive magnetoresistance is observed when the temperature is raised to T≈20K. For fields perpendicular to the CuO2 layers, only negative magnetoresistance is observed. The nature of the positive magnetoresistance is discussed. It is shown that the effect is most likely due not to the interaction of the spin of the charge carriers with the surrounding magnetic medium but to the orbital motion of these carriers. The corresponding values of the positive magnetoresistance and its behavior as a function of magnetic field and temperature are found using the well-known model of Shklovskii and Efros, which is based on taking into account the compression of the impurity wave functions of the charge carriers in the magnetic field.},

The properties are found to be influenced by the magnetic anisotropy and inhomogeneity. Magnetoresistance anisotropy is determined by the shape anisotropy of the magnetization and the strain-induced magnetic anisotropy due to the film-substrate lattice interaction. Indications of the temperature-driven spin reorientation transition from an out-of-plane ordered state at low temperatures to an in-plane ordered state at high temperatures as a result of competition between the aforementioned sources of magnetic anisotropy are found.},

In order to analyze the experimental magnetovolume effect, d ln χ/d ln V, the volume-dependent electronic structure of CeCo2 has been calculated ab initio by employing a relativistic full-potential LMTO method. The calculations have brought out strong hybridization of the itinerant 4f (Ce) and 3d (Co) states, which leads to a filling of the peculiar bonding band. It is demonstrated that the magnetic properties of CeCo2 are consistent with itinerant behavior of the 4f electrons of cerium. The large volume derivative of the effective electron-electron interaction parameter, d ln I/d ln V ≃ - 1.7, implies a predominant role of the short-range correlations, in accordance with the Hubbard model.},

  Abstract                 = {The ferromagnetic state of the itinerant compound UFe2 correlated with a peak in the density of states at the Fermi level is well known to be strongly suppressed by replacing Fe with other 3d elements. To separate the effect of change in filling of the band from that of its deformation under alloying, the magnetic susceptibility of both quasi-binary alloys U(Fe1-xMex)(2) (Me=Mn, Co) with a varying number of valence electrons and isoelectronic quasi-ternary alloys U(Fe1-xTx)(2), U(Fe0.9-xMn0.1Tx)(2) and U(Fe0.9-xCo0.1Tx)(2) (T=Mn0.5Co0.5) was studied in the temperature range 4.2 K less than or equal to T less than or equal to 300 K. Both effects were found to play important roles in suppression of the ferromagnetic state in UFe2-based alloys. In addition, the magnetic susceptibility of U(Fe1-xMnx)(2) and U(Fe1-xTx)(2) alloys and UCo2 compound have been studied under pressure up to 4 kbar at T=78 and 293 K. The volume dependence of the exchange enhancement in spin paramagnetism of the UFe2 compound and its alloys has been derived from analysis of the pressure effects in the framework of the Stoner model.

For YbInCu4, which exhibits a first-order valence phase transition at TV ≃ 40 K, the Grüneisen parameter for the Kondo energy, ΩK ≡ -d ln TK/d ln V = -32, is large and typical for Ce-based heavy-fermion systems in magnitude but opposite in sign. The effect of atomic disorder is discussed on the basis of the data for a chemically disordered sample; the pressure effect at T = 78 K is strongly enhanced due to the spatial dispersion of pressure-sensitive TV, and hence dTV/dP = -2.0 K kbar-1 is obtained by assuming a Gaussian distribution of TV. On the basis of an extrapolation of the experimental pressure dependence, a (P, T) phase diagram is proposed for YbInCu4. Reference compounds with stable f moments, GdInCu4 and ErInCu4, show negligible pressure dependences of the susceptibility.},

  Abstract                 = {The unusual non-linear effects in hopping conduction of single-crystal La2CuO4+δ with excess oxygen has been observed. The resistance is measured as a function of the applied voltage U (voltage controlled regime) in the temperature range 5 K≤T≤300 K and voltage range 10-3 - 25 V. At relatively high voltage (approximately at U&gt;0.1 V) the conduction of sample investigated corresponds well to variable-range hopping (VRH). That is, in the range 0.1 V &lt; U ≤ 1 V the conductivity does not depend on U (Ohmic behavior) and the temperature dependence of resistance R(T) follows closely Mott's law of VRH [R∝exp(T0/T)1/4]. In the range of highest applied voltage the conduction has been non-Ohmic: the resistance decreases with increasing U. This non-linear effect is quite expected in the frame of VRH mechanism, since the applied electric field increases the hopping probability. A completely different and unusual conduction behavior is found, however, in the low voltage range (approximately below 0.1 V), where the influence of electric field and (or) electron heating effect on VRH ought to be neglected. Here we have observed strong increase in resistance at increasing U at T ≤20 K, whereas at T&gt;20 K the resistance decreases with increasing U. The magnetoresistance of the sample below 20 K has been positive at low voltage and negative at high voltage. The observed unusual non-Ohmic behavior at low voltage range is attributable to inhomogeneity of the sample, namely, to the enrichment of sample surface with oxygen during the course of the heat treatment of the sample in helium and air atmosphere before measurements. At low enough temperature (below ≈20 K) the surface layer with increased oxygen concentration is presumed to consist of disconnected superconducting regions in a poorly conducting (dielectric) matrix. This allows us to explain the observed unusual non-linear effects in the conduction of sample studied. The results obtained demonstrate that in some cases the measured transport properties of cuprate oxides cannot be attributed to the intrinsic bulk properties.},

Moreover, the last contribution reveals a negligible pressure dependence for the reference GdInCu4 compound. For the YbInCu4 compound at T = 78 K, the pressure effect is significantly enhanced and is explained, in line with the temperature dependence of the susceptibility itself near the transition temperature Tv, in terms of spatial dispersion of its pressure dependence due to some atomic disorder.},

In order to analyze the experimental magnetovolume effect, to be specific dln x/dln V, the volume dependent electronic structure of UGa3 has been calculated ab initio in the paramagnetic phase by employing a relativistic full-potential LMTO method. The effect of the external magnetic field was included self-consistently by means of the Zeeman operator, as well as orbital polarization. The calculations have brought out a predominance of itinerant uranium 5f states at the Fermi energy, as well as large and competing orbital and spin contributions to x. The calculated field-induced magnetic moment of UGa3 and its volume derivative compare favorably with our experimental results.},

  Abstract                 = {Magnetic susceptibility of RNi5 single crystals (R=Gd, Tb, Dy) was studied under uniform and uniaxial pressures at temperatures above TC. The uniform pressure derivatives of the paramagnetic Curie temperature Θ and the crystalline electric field parameter B0 2 appear to be small. On the other hand, Θ and B0 2 parameters display a large sensitivity to the uniaxial pressure due to related changes of c/a ratio. Ab initio electronic structure calculation was performed for GdNi5 to evaluate the volume derivative of TC.},

The effect of pressure P up to 2 kbar on the magnetic susceptibility χ of this system was measured at 78, 150, and 295 K. The value of d In χ/dP obtained is well above those observed for similar RE compounds with stable valences. This derivative tends to decrease with temperature, and to increase (but not monotonically) with the tin content x. The experimental data on d In χ/dp (x,T) were analysed in terms of the changes in the spin-fluctuation temperature Tsf.},

Assuming the leading role of the gap value Eg as the energy parameter in this range the value dln Eg/dln V = -6 was evaluated. The electronic structure of FeSi was determined using the local spin-density functional approximation and the LMTO method to solve the band structure problem self-consistently. The obtained fine structure of the density of states near the gap differs from the DOS curve for MnSi. The stability of monosilicides is discussed by considering the bonding origin of electronic states near the Fermi energy. The calculated derivative dln Eg/dln V = -5.9 is in agreement with the experimental one.},

These features are closely associated with the defect (impurity) content in the samples.

The results obtained show that Y1Ba2CuO3 undergoes a phase transition at 50, 150, and 220 K which influences both electron and lattice characteristics. The observed temperature dependences of electrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility indicate the fluctuation of carriers above the critical temperature.

The values of parameters of modified Curie-Weiss law which the susceptibility is subjected to at T>40 K are ascertained. One cannot observe any effect to superconductivity caused by deviations from stochiometry and the existence of accompaning phases. The known low-temperature characteristic features of susceptibility can be attributed to antiferromagnetic order in U2Zn17 at T=10K.},

The experimental results are discussed within the framework of a simple empirical description of the variation of the electron spectrum of transition metals under pressure, containing deformation of the d-band and a relative shift of the s- and d-states on the Fermi level.},

The experimental results can be satisfactorily explained within the framework of a proposed simple model of changes in the electron spectrum induced by hydrostatic pressure, in which d-band deformation and a relative shift of the s-and d-bands are assumed. Values of parameters describing both mechanisms are obtained.},
