  Abstract                 = {A SQUID magnetometer-based method is proposed to measure the effects of uniaxial pressure (up to 1-2 kbar) on the magnetic moment of solids in the temperature range 4.2-300 K. The method was used to study the magnetic susceptibility of the single crystal CeAl2 in the paramagnetic state. The results obtained show a strong uniaxial pressure effect and its high anisotropy for various magnetic field directions with respect to the stress.},

  Abstract                 = {The flow stress of a ferromagnetic, nickel, for example, falls by Δσ in a pulsating magnetic field. This is called the magnetoplastic effect (MPE). In order to clarify the nature of the MPE, the values of Δσ and the fall in flow stress of polycrystalline nickel (99.95%) were determined in a pulsating magnetic field of strength H0=48 kA/m and frequency f=50 Hz at T=300, 77 and 4.2 K. The nature of the MPE consists in intensification of heat activated dislocation processes in a magnetized ferromagnetic owing not only to the effective stresses near stopped dislocations increased by domain walls, as previously suggested, but also generation of the heat of hysteresis during Barkhausen discontinuities and the appearance of Joule heat of eddy currents by the walls.},

  Abstract                 = {The variation in susceptibility during elastic and plastic deformation at low temperatures is due to the formation of a ferromagnetic alpha phase as a result of the martensitic gamma yields alpha transformation, and to the magnetoelasticity of the alpha and gamma phases. The mean internal stresses in alpha phase crystallites are greater at lower temperatures and higher nickel concentrations. Spasmodic deformation at 4.2 K is not connected with the martensitic transformation.},

  Abstract                 = {The low temperature (T=4.2 K) plastic deformation of stainless FeCrNi steels (18Cr8Ni, 18Cr10Ni, 18Cr15Ni, 18Cr20Ni and 18Cr25Ni) has been studied in constant (H = 2.71 × 103 Am-1) and transient magnetic fields (H ≤ 2.71 × 103 Am-1) changing exponentially in time at different rates. It is stated that the constant magnetic field of 2.71 × 103 Am-1 does not influence the tensile properties and plastic deformation of steels, but the transient magnetic fields lead to changes in deforming stress. The conclusion is made that the effects observed are due to the linear magnetostriction of steels and the Joule heating by eddy currents.},

It has been established that a constant magnetic field H = 34 kOe increases the flow limit of nickel by about 10% while transient magnetic fields cause a change in the deforming stress. It is concluded that the observed effects can be explained by magnetostriction and Joule heating of the nickel samples by Eddy currents.},
