abstract={Susceptibility changes were examined at 4 multiplied by (times) 2, 77 and 300 K. The magneto-elastic variations are due to differences in the magnetic state. Some features of irregular low-temperature deformation are due to heating the test specimens.},

abstract={The temperature dependence of susceptibility is investigated in the range T equals 4. 2-300 K, together with its variation under the influence of elastic tensile stresses at T equals 4. 2, 77 and 300 K. It is concluded that these steels belong to the amorphous group known as mictomagnets. The phenomenon of magnetoelasticity is found in magnets with long-range magnetic order.},

abstract={The variation in susceptibility during elastic and plastic deformation at low temperatures is due to the formation of a ferromagnetic alpha phase as a result of the martensitic gamma yields alpha transformation, and to the magnetoelasticity of the alpha and gamma phases. The mean internal stresses in alpha phase crystallites are greater at lower temperatures and higher nickel concentrations. Spasmodic deformation at 4. 2 K is not connected with the martensitic transformation.},

abstract={The effect of an alternating magnetic field on the plastic deformation of nickel and aluminum was examined at 4. 2, 77, and 300 degree K, and the energy loss due to eddy currents was measured at 77 degree K only. It has been found that the characteristics of metal softening in an alternating magnetic field, the magnetoplastic effect, can be fully attributed to the temperature increase due to Joule heating by eddy currents.},

abstract={Low-temperature (T equals 4. 2 degree K) plastic deformation in polycrystalline nickel has been studied in constant (H equals 34 kOe) and transient (H less than equivalent to 34 kOe) magnetic fields which change exponentially in time at different rates. It has been established that a constant magnetic field H equals 34 kOe increases the flow limit of nickel by about 10% while transient magnetic fields cause a change in the deforming stress. It is concluded that the observed effects can be explained by magnetostriction and Joule heating of the nickel samples by eddy currents.},
