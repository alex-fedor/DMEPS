  Abstract                 = {The magnetic susceptibility of ferromagnetic GdM alloys (M=Cu1-xGax, Mg, Zn) has been investigated under helium gas pressure for temperatures above T-C. The evaluated pressure derivatives of the paramagnetic Curie temperature, d ln Theta/dP, appeared to be remarkably different for isovalent GdMg and GdZn compounds (-11.2 and -0.1 Mbar(-1), respectively). An analysis of the obtained d ln Theta/dP values for GdCu1-xGax alloys and results of ab initio electronic structure calculations have revealed the essential role of 5d electrons as the mediators of exchange coupling in ferromagnetic GdM compounds. The pressure derivatives of T-C were calculated by employing the modern mean-field theory, as well as the spin-fluctuation model. As a result, good agreement is found with the experimental values of d ln Theta/dP.},

In order to analyze the experimental magnetovolume effect, to be specific dln x/dln V, the volume dependent electronic structure of UGa3 has been calculated ab initio in the paramagnetic phase by employing a relativistic full-potential LMTO method. The effect of the external magnetic field was included self-consistently by means of the Zeeman operator, as well as orbital polarization. The calculations have brought out a predominance of itinerant uranium 5f states at the Fermi energy, as well as large and competing orbital and spin contributions to x. The calculated field-induced magnetic moment of UGa3 and its volume derivative compare favorably with our experimental results.},
