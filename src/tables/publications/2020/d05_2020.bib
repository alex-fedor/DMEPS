  Abstract                 = {The temperature behavior of the crystal structure as well as dielectric and magnetic properties of the perovskite bismuth chromate ceramics with the 10 mol \% Cr3+-to-Sc3+ substitution were studied and compared with those of the unmodified compound. Using a high-pressure synthesis, BiCrO3 and BiCr0.9Sc0.1O3 were obtained as metastable perovskite phases which are monoclinic C2/c with the √6ap × √2ap × √6ap superstructure (where ap is the primitive perovskite unit-cell parameter) under ambient conditions. At room temperature, the unit cell volume of BiCr0.9Sc0.1O3 is ∼1.3\% larger than that of BiCrO3. Both perovskites undergo a reversible structural transition into a nonpolar GdFeO3-type phase (orthorhombic Pnma, √2ap × 2ap × √2ap) in the temperature ranges of 410–420 K (BiCrO3) and 470–520 K (BiCr0.9Sc0.1O3) with a relative jump of the primitive perovskite unit cell volume of about −1.6 and −2.0\%, respectively. Temperature dependences of the complex dielectric permittivity demonstrate anomalies in the phase transition ranges. The Pnma-to-C2/c crossover in BiCrO3 is accompanied by a decrease in the direct current (dc) conductivity, while in BiCr0.9Sc0.1O3 the conductivity increases. The onset of an antiferromagnetic order in BiCr0.9Sc0.1O3 is observed at the Néel temperature (TN) of about 85 K as compared with TN = 110 K in BiCrO3. In contrast to BiCrO3, which exhibits a spin reorientation at Tsr ∼ 72 K, no such a transition occurs in BiCr0.9Sc0.1O3.},

  Abstract                 = {The crystal structure, magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature chi(T) in the range 5-400 K, and the hydrostatic pressure effect on chi at fixed temperaturesT = 78, 150, and 300 K, were studied in perovskite-like compounds La1-xPrxCoO3(x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3). The obtained experimental data were analyzed using a two-level model with an energy gap Delta between the ground and excited states of the system that correspond to the spin valuesS = 0 and 1 for Co(3+)ions. In this model, the magnetism of Co(3+)ions, which determines the features of the
 chi (T) dependence, is ensured by the temperature-induced change in the population of the excited state. The anomalously large magnitude of the observed pressure effect is associated with the high sensitivity of Delta to changes in the lattice volume, under the influence of both hydrostatic and chemical pressures, when La is replaced by the smaller Pr ion in the considered system. Theoretical calculations of the electronic structure for the boundary compounds LaCoO(3)and PrCoO(3)confirm the significant increase in the excitation energy Delta with a decrease in the lattice volume, and also support the scenario of a spin crossover between the states of cobalt ions with low and intermediate spin values.},

  Abstract                 = {Analysis of XRD patterns by Rietveld refinement has been shown that the main phase of superconducting MgB2-based bulk materials (with high level of superconducting characteristics) has AlB2 type structure and near MgB1.8-1.68O0.2-0.32 stoichiometry. The materials demonstrated the critical current densities up to 0.9 – 0.4 MA/cm2 j c (at 0 - 1 T, 20 K); up to 15 T B c2 (at 22.5 K) and Birr (at 18 K). The ab-initio simulation confirmed (1) benefits in binding energy and enthalpy of formation if stoichiometry of the solid solution is near MgB1.75O0.25; (2) energetic advantage in case if impurity oxygen present only in each second boron plane of MgB2 cell while the first boron plane of the same cell stays pristine and location of substituted oxygen atoms in the nearby positions. Besides, the results of ab-initio modeling allow explanation of the tendency towards segregation of O-impurity in MgB2 structure during synthesis or sintering, and formation of Mg-B-O inclusions or nanolayers (with MgO type of structure) which effect pinning. Calculated transition temperatures, Tc, for MgB1.75O0.25 occurred to be 23.3 K, while for MgB2 it was 21.13 K only. Experimental Tc of the bulk materials was 35.7-38.2 K.},

  Abstract                 = {Below the Néel temperature, T<sub>N</sub>∼220 K, at least two nano-scale antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases coexist in the polar polymorph of the BiFe<sub>0.5</sub>Sc<sub>0.5</sub>O<sub>3</sub> perovskite; one of these phases is a weak ferromagnetic. Non-uniform structure distortions induced by high-pressure synthesis lead to competing AFM orders and a nano-scale spontaneous magnetic phase separated state of the compound. Interface exchange coupling between the AFM domains and the weak ferromagnetic domains causes unidirectional anisotropy of magnetization, resulting in the exchange bias (EB) effect. The EB field, H<sub>EB</sub> , and the coercive field strongly depend on temperature and the strength of the cooling magnetic field. H<sub>EB</sub> increases with an increase in the cooling magnetic field and reaches a maximum value of about 1 kOe at 5 K. The exchange field vanishes above T<sub>N</sub> with the disappearance of long-range magnetic ordering. The effect is promising for applications in electronics as it is large enough and as it is tunable by temperature and the magnetic field applied during cooling.},

It was revealed that the Faraday rotation φ varies with thickness of the Cu layers dCu. This φ(dCu) dependence consists of the monotonic component, namely a gradual rise of the angle with increase of dCu, and the non-monotonic one represented by two minima. The monotonic changes of the Faraday rotation were satisfactory described in frames of the effective medium method. Two minima are explained with the Co layer’s fragmentation due to influence of size electron quantization in the Cu layers on formation of Co clusters during deposition of the films.},
