Abstract = {The densities of phonon states and their related vibrational
   thermodynamic characteristics, such as heat capacity, root-mean-square
   displacement of atoms, and thermal expansion, are calculated and
   analyzed at the microscopic level for graphite and graphene
   nanoformations, such as nanofilms and nanotubes. The simulation model is
   based on experimental data without a priori assumptions as to the nature
   and potentials of interatomic interactions, and is compared to them only
   after, which yields a good agreement. The quasi-flexural and torsional
   modes, which are inherent to graphene nanotubes, are considered and
   their contribution to the low temperature vibrational characteristics
   are analyzed. The impact that extended defects, such as graphite
   intercalation with transition metals, step-edges on graphene nanofilms,
   and edges of a graphene single layer on a substrate, have on the phonon
   spectrum and vibrational characteristics is analyzed. The calculated
   results are compared to the experimental data.},
