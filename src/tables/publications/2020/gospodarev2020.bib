Abstract = {The total electron densities of states for graphene nanoribbons with
   edges of different chirality, as well as the electron local densities of
   states for individual atoms in these nanoribbons, are calculated and
   analyzed. There are sharp resonance peaks near the Fermi level in the
   total electron densities of states of graphene nanoribbons with zigzag
   edges, which emerge only in the local densities of atoms from the
   sublattice that goes directly to the nearest edge (i.e., whose atoms
   have dangling bonds). Semiconducting gaps appear in the spectra of
   graphene nanobands with armchair chirality edges having a number of
   constituent atomic lines that is either a multiple of three, or gives a
   remainder of one when divided by three. The width of this gap only
   depends on the width of the nanoribbon, and is the same for all its
   atoms. The electron spectra of graphene nanoribbons with
   armchair-chirality edges have a metallic behavior if the number of
   atomic lines gives a remainder of two when divided by three. However,
   semiconducting gaps still manifest on the local densities of the atoms
   belonging to some lines of such nanoribbons. Published under license by
