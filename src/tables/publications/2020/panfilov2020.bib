Abstract = {The crystal structure, magnetic susceptibility as a function of
   temperature chi(T) in the range 5-400 K, and the hydrostatic pressure
   effect on chi at fixed temperaturesT = 78, 150, and 300 K, were studied
   in perovskite-like compounds La1-xPrxCoO3(x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3). The
   obtained experimental data were analyzed using a two-level model with an
   energy gap Delta between the ground and excited states of the system
   that correspond to the spin valuesS = 0 and 1 for Co(3+)ions. In this
   model, the magnetism of Co(3+)ions, which determines the features of the
   chi (T) dependence, is ensured by the temperature-induced change in the
   population of the excited state. The anomalously large magnitude of the
   observed pressure effect is associated with the high sensitivity of
   Delta to changes in the lattice volume, under the influence of both
   hydrostatic and chemical pressures, when La is replaced by the smaller
   Pr ion in the considered system. Theoretical calculations of the
   electronic structure for the boundary compounds LaCoO(3)and
   PrCoO(3)confirm the significant increase in the excitation energy Delta
   with a decrease in the lattice volume, and also support the scenario of
   a spin crossover between the states of cobalt ions with low and
   intermediate spin values.},
