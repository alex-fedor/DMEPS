abstract={The piezomagnetoelectric effect is considered to be the appearance of a piezoelectric response caused by a magnetic field in magnetically ordered media. The possibility of its existence in antiferromagnets was predicted in the 1960's; however, attempts at its experimental detection were unsuccessful.

abstract={The influence of the external magnetic field on the Jahn-Teller phase transition at Tc ≈ 14 K is studied in the single crystal KDy(MoO4)2. At temperatures below Tc the essential change of the velocity and attenuation of acoustic modes of the crystal is discovered in the magnetic field, oriented along the [110] direction. Such a behavior of elastic characteristics is determined by the destruction of the antiferrodistorsive ordering, connected, in turn, with the ordering of the quadrupole orbital moments, charecteristic for the "orbital nematic". The low temperature part of the H-T phase diagram for this direction of the field is restored. It is disco-vered that the critical temperature dependence on the field is nonmonotonic, i.e., the phase transition has the re-entrant character. Theoretical description of the observed anomalies of the temperature and magnetic field behavior of the acoustic characteristics is given.},
