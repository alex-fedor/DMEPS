abstract={The temperature dependencies of the amplitude and phase of the electric potential appearing at the flat conductor boundary under perpendicular incidence of a longitudinal sound wave have been investigated. The surface potential is formed by two bulk contributions: the first one is spatially periodic with the period of the sound wave, and the second aperiodic contribution arises due to additional inhomogeneity of the electron distribution near the metal surface. The latter contribution dominates within a nonlocal region of the parameters. The phase shift between these contributions is nearly π/2. In a normal state the experimental results qualitatively agree with the theory. Under the superconducting transition the electric potential abruptly vanishes in contrast to the theory, which predicts its behavior similar to the BCS dependence of longitudinal sound attenuation.},

The experimental temperature dependences of the amplitude and the phase velocity of these signals have been studied in the normal and superconducting state. They interpret this effect observed earlier in Ga by Burma et al. as the excitation of a weakly damped zero-sound wave caused by the Fermi-liquid interaction between charge carriers. A dominating role of the electron-electron collisions in the zero-sound damping in Mo was established, and the corresponding relaxation time was estimated. Theoretical calculations of the expected zero-sound behaviour in a superconductor are in good agreement with the experimental data and enable them to determine the intensity of the Fermi-liquid interaction.},

abstract={The predicted ≪non-collision≫ magnetoacoustic resonance (MAR) occuring under the condition of weak aperiodicity of the electron movement along quasi-open trajectories is experimentally detected and investigated. For the cross-section of the open region of the Fermi surface (FS) of gallium providing the extreme electron drift, the value of (∂3S/∂pξ3)pξextreme (S is the area of the corresponding section, pξ the Fermi momentum perpendicular to the vector of openness) is measured.},

abstract={Comparison studies of elastic characteristics for metallic glasses of different composition (Ni78Si8B14 and Fe5Ni10Co60Si10B15) are carried out. Time relaxation of the density of states in two-level systems is found. The physical nature of different contributions to sound velocity in a low-temperature region is considered. Taking beryllium bronze BRB-2 as an example, it is shown that the alloy disorder influences appreciably the sound velocity behaviour.},

abstract={The behavior of sound velocity in quasi-two-dimensional antiferromagnets of a system (NH2)2 (CH2)n MnCl4 (n=U3,4,5) is studied. According to their elastic properties, these compounds can be classified among layered ones. The Neel temperatures for this series are defined more exactly by distinguishing features of sound velocity near the antiferromagnetic ordering point. The H-T diagram at magnetic fields up to 4 T is constructed for the compound (NH3)2 MnCl4.},

abstract={The behavior of acoustical characteristics of yttrium ceramics of frequency of about 50 MHz is studied. The temperature region above 30-40 K is characterized by pronounced hystresis effects which are dependent on porosity of samples and inhomogeneity of their composition in oxygen. These effects are supposed to be responsible for by twinning of crystallites due to additional stresses in samples. Possible mechanisms of such stresses are considered. The sound velocity at T<20 K increases linearity with decrease in temperature, reaches a maximum at T approximately 1 K and then decreases. Such a behavior typical of amorphous media is rather due to interaction between elastic waves and two-level systems.},
