abstract={The influence of the external magnetic field on the Jahn-Teller phase transition at Tc ≈ 14 K is studied in the single crystal KDy(MoO4)2. At temperatures below Tc the essential change of the velocity and attenuation of acoustic modes of the crystal is discovered in the magnetic field, oriented along the [110] direction. Such a behavior of elastic characteristics is determined by the destruction of the antiferrodistorsive ordering, connected, in turn, with the ordering of the quadrupole orbital moments, charecteristic for the "orbital nematic". The low temperature part of the H-T phase diagram for this direction of the field is restored. It is disco-vered that the critical temperature dependence on the field is nonmonotonic, i.e., the phase transition has the re-entrant character. Theoretical description of the observed anomalies of the temperature and magnetic field behavior of the acoustic characteristics is given.},

abstract={The low-temperature elastic characteristics of single-crystal Nd<inf>0.9</inf>Dy<inf>0.1</inf>Fe<inf>3</inf>(BO<inf>3</inf>)<inf>4</inf> are studied. A transition of the magnetic system into an antiferromagnetic ordered state and a spontaneous spin-reorientation phase transition are observed in the temperature behavior of the speed and absorption of acoustic modes. Two anomalies in the speed and absorption of transverse acoustic modes are discovered at the lowest experimental temperature of 1.7K in an external magnetic field directed along the trigonal axis of the crystal. These features are associated with two reorientation phase transitions that follow one another. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract={Piezomagnetic response of CoF2 single crystals has been studied using acoustic oscillations at frequencies of ~ 55 MHz. In the absence of external magnetic field the results reproduce the data of direct static meas-urements. In the magnetic field there appears an addi-tional channel of the piezomagnetic response linear in field strength. The efficiencies of both channels are comparable in the antiferromagnetic state at H ~ 3 T. The mechanism of the first channel disappears above the Néel temperature, and the piezomagnetic response, related to the new channel, reveals a decay, well ap-proximated by the exponential law.

abstract={The acoustic-electric transformation in high-quality FeSe single crystals is studied. In zero magnetic field we observe an abnormally strong electromagnetic radiation induced by a transverse elastic wave. Usually a radiation of such intensity and polarization is observed only in metals subjected to a high magnetic field (the radiation is caused by the Hall current). We argue that in FeSe in zero magnetic field it is caused by the piezomagnetic effect which is most probably of dynamical origin. We find that the piezomagnetism survives under the transition from the normal to superconducting state. In the superconducting state the electromagnetic signal decreases with decreasing temperature that is connected with the change in the London penetration depth. © Copyright EPLA, 2013.},

The features in the temperature behavior of elastic characteristics of the neodymium ferroborate and its behavior in the external magnetic field, applied in the basic plane of the crystal, permit us to suppose that the transition to an incommensurate spiral phase is realized in the system. This phase transition behaves as the first order one. H-T phase diagrams for the cases H || a and H || b have been constructed. The phenomenological theory, which explains observed features, has been developed. © G.A. Zvyagina, K.R. Zhekov, I.V. Bilych, A.A. Zvyagin, I.A. Gudim, and V.L. Temerov, 2011.},

abstract={The pumping of the energy of a longitudinal sound by a quantum spin chain with the alternation of coupling constants is studied theoretically. It is shown that the power of the sound wave, absorbed by the dimerized spin chain, is zero in the dynamical regime, i.e., at times, smaller than relaxation times. In the steady-state regime, for times, larger than the relaxation time, the dimerized quantum spin chain can absorb the power of the sound. We have shown that the absorption of the sound exists when the frequency of the wave is between two threshold values, related to two critical fields, at which quantum phase transitions take place. Contrary, the calculated magnetic field dependence of the absorbed power of the sound does not clearly manifest two critical fields. Nevertheless, we have shown that it is possible to extract the information about the value of the field, at which the spin gap of low-lying excitations is closed, from the temperature dependence of the absorption of the longitudinal sound. © 2006 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={Recently several compounds were observed to reveal properties of a one-dimensional spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain with gapless low-lying spin excitations in an absence of an external magnetic field. However even a very weak external magnetic field yields an onset of a spin gap for those low-lying excitations. Usually this onset of a field-induced spin gap is related to the presence of a staggered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, or to the staggered effective g factors of magnetic ions. Experiments on thermodynamic properties cannot distinguish between those two origins for the spin-gap formation. Here we propose the setup for an experiment, in which one can clearly distinguish between the staggered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya coupling and staggered external magnetic field: an electronic paramagnetic resonance in the parallel pumping geometry. The characteristics of the system under conditions of such an experiment, i.e., the renormalization of the homogeneous and staggered magnetizations, power of the microwave magnetic field, absorbed by the system, are calculated. Several important features of the solution are discussed.},
