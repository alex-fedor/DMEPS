abstract={Piezomagnetic response of CoF2 single crystals has been studied using acoustic oscillations at frequencies of ~ 55 MHz. In the absence of external magnetic field the results reproduce the data of direct static meas-urements. In the magnetic field there appears an addi-tional channel of the piezomagnetic response linear in field strength. The efficiencies of both channels are comparable in the antiferromagnetic state at H ~ 3 T. The mechanism of the first channel disappears above the Néel temperature, and the piezomagnetic response, related to the new channel, reveals a decay, well ap-proximated by the exponential law. The sound veloci-ties for different crystallographic directions have been measured and the components of the tensor of elastic moduli have been calculated.},

abstract={The piezomagnetic response of single crystal CoF<inf>2</inf> is studied using acoustic oscillations at frequencies of ~55 MHz. Without an external magnetic field the results reproduce the data from direct static measurements. A magnetic field opens up an additional piezomagnetic response channel with an amplitude that is linear in the field strength. The efficiencies of the two channels become equal in the antiferromagnetic state for H ~ 3 T. Above the Neel temperature the mechanism for the first channel ceases to operate, while the piezomagnetic response associated with the new channel falls off approximately exponentially. The sound speeds for the different crystallographic directions are measured and the components of the elastic modulus tensor are calculated. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract={The acoustic-electric transformation in high-quality FeSe single crystals is studied. In zero magnetic field we observe an abnormally strong electromagnetic radiation induced by a transverse elastic wave. Usually a radiation of such intensity and polarization is observed only in metals subjected to a high magnetic field (the radiation is caused by the Hall current). We argue that in FeSe in zero magnetic field it is caused by the piezomagnetic effect which is most probably of dynamical origin. We find that the piezomagnetism survives under the transition from the normal to superconducting state. In the superconducting state the electromagnetic signal decreases with decreasing temperature that is connected with the change in the London penetration depth. © Copyright EPLA, 2013.},

abstract={The results of the comprehensive ultrasonic research of high-quality single crystals of FeSe are presented. Absolute values of sound velocities and their temperature dependences were measured; elastic constants and Debye temperature were calculated. The elastic C11-C12 and C11 constants undergo significant softening under the structural tetra-ortho transformation. The significant influence of the superconducting transition on the velocity and attenuation of sound was revealed and the value of the superconducting energy gap was estimated. © Copyright EPLA, 2013.},
