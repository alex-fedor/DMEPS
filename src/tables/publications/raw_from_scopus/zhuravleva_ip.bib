abstract={The magnetic properties of Fe1+yTe single crystals (y≃ 0.10.18) were studied at temperatures 4.2300K. At an ambient pressure, with decreasing temperature a drastic drop in χ(T) was confirmed at T≃ 6065K, which appears to be closely related to the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering. It is found that the magnitudes of the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility Δχ in the AFM phase are close in the studied samples, whereas the sign of the anisotropy apparently depends on the small variations of the excess iron y in Fe1+yTe samples. The performed DFT calculations of the electronic structure and magnetic properties for the stoichiometric FeTe compound indicate the presence of frustrated AFM ground states. There are very close energies and magnetic moments for the double stripe configurations, with the AFM axes oriented either on the basal plane or along the [0 0 1] direction. Presumably, both these configurations can be realized in Fe1+yTe single crystals, depending on the variations of the excess iron. This can provide different signs of magnetic anisotropy in the AFM phase, presently observed in the Fe1+yTe samples. For these types of AFM configuration, the calculations for the FeTe values of Δχ are consistent with our experimental data. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Experimental and theoretical studies of pressure effects on magnetic properties and electronic structure of gadolinium metal were carried out to shed more light on the nature of magnetic ordering and interactions between the localized 4f moments. The dc paramagnetic susceptibility of Gd was measured in the temperature range 295-365 K and under hydrostatic pressure up to 0.16 GPa, yielding values of the paramagnetic Curie temperature Θ and its pressure derivative. Based on the results of ab initio electronic structure calculations, the experimental behavior of Θ under hydrostatic pressure together with the literature data on the uniform and uniaxial pressure effects was examined within a mean-field like approach. For this purpose, the effective d-band susceptibility and the relevant exchange integrals were calculated as functions of the lattice parameters within the density functional theory. These calculations provided a reasonable description of the experimentally observed uniform pressure effect, but a less satisfactory description of the uniaxial pressure effect. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Ab initio calculations of the electronic structures are carried out for the novel FeSe1-xTex superconductors to explain the experimentally found anomalous magnetic properties in the normal state. The calculations have shown that FeSe1-xTex systems are close to a magnetic instability with dominating enhanced spin paramagnetism. The magnetic susceptibility is found to increase gradually with the Te content. The temperature dependences of the magnetic susceptibility χ and its anisotropy Δχ = χII - χ⊥ are investigated for FeSe, and a growth of the susceptibility with the temperature is revealed in the temperature range 4.2-300 K. For FeTe, a substantial increase of χ under pressure is found. The calculated paramagnetic susceptibility exhibits a strong dependence on the unit cell volume V and especially the height of chalcogen species from the Fe plane. The calculations have explained the experimental data on χ(T) and χ(P) for FeSe and FeTe, respectively. © 2012.},
