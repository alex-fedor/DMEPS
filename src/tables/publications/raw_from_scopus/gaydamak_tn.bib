abstract={Magnetodielectric (magnetocapacitance) and magnetopiezoelectric effects in neodymium ferroborate are systematically investigated. The existence of a previously observed magnetopiezoelectric effect in samarium ferroborate is confirmed. This effect consists in indirect renormalization of the piezoelectric modulus as a result of the combined action of the magnetoelectric and magnetoelastic mechanisms. The manifestation of a new type of phenomena-direct renormalization of the piezoelectric interaction in a magnetically ordered phase-is observed. The ratio of the contributions of the rare-earth and iron systems to the magnetoelectric interaction is estimated. It is shown that the latter plays a ballast role, impeding orientation fluctuations of the magnetic structure as a whole. The boundaries of existence of the helicoidal phase on the H-T plane are determined. The phenomenological interpretation of the studied effects is given.},

abstract={A giant magnetopiezoelectric effect has been revealed in samarium ferroborate. The effective piezomodulus is increased more than twice in the antiferromagnetic phase and it is reduced by a high magnetic field. The nature of the effect is in the joint contribution of both magnetoelectric and magnetoelastic interactions. The evolu-tion of this contribution in the magnetic field is caused by the growth of the magnetic energy including the spin reorientation. Additional data concerning the behavior of the high-frequency magnetocapacitance have been obtained. The parameters of magnetoelectric and magnetoelastic couplings and the magnetic anisotropy constant in the basal plane have been determined. © 2015 American Physical Society.},

abstract={Piezomagnetic response of CoF2 single crystals has been studied using acoustic oscillations at frequencies of ~ 55 MHz. In the absence of external magnetic field the results reproduce the data of direct static meas-urements. In the magnetic field there appears an addi-tional channel of the piezomagnetic response linear in field strength. The efficiencies of both channels are comparable in the antiferromagnetic state at H ~ 3 T. The mechanism of the first channel disappears above the Néel temperature, and the piezomagnetic response, related to the new channel, reveals a decay, well ap-proximated by the exponential law. The sound veloci-ties for different crystallographic directions have been measured and the components of the tensor of elastic moduli have been calculated.},

abstract={The acoustic-electric transformation in high-quality FeSe single crystals is studied. In zero magnetic field we observe an abnormally strong electromagnetic radiation induced by a transverse elastic wave. Usually a radiation of such intensity and polarization is observed only in metals subjected to a high magnetic field (the radiation is caused by the Hall current). We argue that in FeSe in zero magnetic field it is caused by the piezomagnetic effect which is most probably of dynamical origin. We find that the piezomagnetism survives under the transition from the normal to superconducting state. In the superconducting state the electromagnetic signal decreases with decreasing temperature that is connected with the change in the London penetration depth. © Copyright EPLA, 2013.},
