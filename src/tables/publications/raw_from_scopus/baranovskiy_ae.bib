abstract={The electrical transport properties of CaO(CaMnO3)m (m = 1, 2, 3, ∞) compounds are studied applying the density functional theory (DFT) in terms of band structure at the vicinity of the Fermi level (EF). It is shown that the total density of states (DOS) values at EF increase with increase in the m-values, which implies an increase in the electrical conductivity, σ, with increasing m-values, in full accordance with experimental results. Additionally, the calculated values of the relative slopes of the DOS at EF correlate with the experimentally measured Seebeck coefficients. The electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficients were calculated in the framework of the Boltzmann transport theory applying the constant relaxation time approximation. By the analysis of experimental and calculated σ(Τ) dependences, the electronic relaxation time and mean free path values were estimated. It is shown that the electrical transport is dominated by electron scattering on the boundaries between perovskite (CaMnO3) and Ca oxide (CaO) layers inside the crystal lattice. © 2017 Author(s).},

abstract={We investigate the crystal structure and bulk properties of calcium-manganate based TE oxides of the CaO(CaMnO3)m(m = 1, 2, 3, ∞) Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) class applying the density functional theory (DFT) approach. We find that the crystal structures of all compounds in this series tend to deviate from the high-symmetry cubic perovskite structure (for the case of m = ∞) or tetragonal I4/mmm structure (for m = 1, 2, and 3). The structure of Ca2MnO4(m = 1) is found to be tetragonal with the I41/acd space group symmetry, whereas the Ca3Mn2O7(m = 2) and Ca4Mn3O10(m = 3) compounds form orthorhombic structures having the Cmc21and Pbca symmetries, respectively; all of the above are formed by combinations of tilted MnO6octahedra. These results are corroborated by X-ray diffraction experiments. This procedure provides us with a powerful tool predicting phase stability and polymorphism. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The band structure details and the related peculiarities of magnetic susceptibility χ have been investigated theoretically in isovalent YbPb 3, YbSn3, CaPb3, and CaSn3 compounds which crystallize into the cubic AuCu3 structure. The degeneracy point of the energy bands close to the Fermi level is found to be responsible for the temperature dependent anomalous diamagnetism in these compounds. The degeneracy point positions in the band spectra of the compounds have been refined and adjusted by fitting the experimental data on χ(T).},

abstract={The electronic structures of RB6, RB12 and RB 2C2 borides are studied ab initio by using the full-potential linear muffin-tin orbital method. This study includes the promising materials for spin electronics with reported high temperature ferromagnetism, namely, doped divalent hexaborides CaB6, SrB 6, BaB6, and the CaB2C2 compound, as well as Kondo semiconductors, SmB6 and YbB12. For CaBe and SrB6 a semiconducting band structure has been obtained, whereas a semimetallic ground state is revealed for CaB2C2 and doped hexaborides. For YB6, LaB6, CaB2C 2 and the semimetallic Ba1-xLaxB6 alloys we have performed spin-polarized band structure calculations in an external field to evaluate the induced spin and orbital magnetic moments. These calculations indicate a feasibility of the field-induced weak ferromagnetic phase in ~CaB2C2 and the La doped hexaborides. The LSDA and GGA calculations for different spin configurations of YbB12 point to a possibility of antiferromagnetic coupling between Yb3+ ions. For SmB6 and YbB12 our LSDA, GGA, and LSDA+U calculations have not revealed the hybridization gap for configurations with trivalent Sm3+ and Yb3+. © 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA,.},

This study revealed well defined peculiarities in the concentration dependences TN(x), the paramagnetic Curie temperature Θ (x), as well as the pressure effect dlnχ(x)/dP. The experimental estimates of the volume derivative dlnΘ/dlnV and results of ab initio calculations of the volume-dependent electronic structure of alloys were used to analyze the nature of f-f interactions in the GdIn3-xSnx system.},
