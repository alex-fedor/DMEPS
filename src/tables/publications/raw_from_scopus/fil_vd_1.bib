abstract={The acoustic-electric transformation in high-quality FeSe single crystals is studied. In zero magnetic field we observe an abnormally strong electromagnetic radiation induced by a transverse elastic wave. Usually a radiation of such intensity and polarization is observed only in metals subjected to a high magnetic field (the radiation is caused by the Hall current). We argue that in FeSe in zero magnetic field it is caused by the piezomagnetic effect which is most probably of dynamical origin. We find that the piezomagnetism survives under the transition from the normal to superconducting state. In the superconducting state the electromagnetic signal decreases with decreasing temperature that is connected with the change in the London penetration depth. © Copyright EPLA, 2013.},

The potential and the elastic components of the electron sound demonstrate qualitatively different dependencies on the electron relaxation rate: while the phase of the potential increases with temperature, the phase of elastic displacement decreases. This effect is explained within the multiband model, in which the potential is attributed to the ballistic quasiwave, while the elastic component is associated with the zero-sound wave. We observed a mysterious property of the superconducting state: all manifestations of the potential accompanying the lattice deformations, including usual sound wave, disappear below T c in almost jumplike manner. © 2011 American Physical Society.},

abstract={We present an acoustic method for the study of the effective Magnus force in type-II superconductors. The method is based on the measurement of the amplitude and the phase of the electromagnetic field radiated by a superconductor due to vortex oscillations excited by a transverse elastic wave. The method does not require the flux flow regime and allows us to measure the Magnus force almost everywhere over the range of the existence of the mixed state. We have measured the field dependence of the Magnus force in nonmagnetic borocarbides (electron-type conductors) and in Nb (hole-type conductor). It is found that in borocarbides the sign of the Magnus force in the mixed state has the same sign as the Lorentz force acting on charge carriers in the normal state, and its value (counted per one vortex of unit length) has only a weak dependence on the magnetic field. In Nb the gyroscopic force changes its sign under transition from the normal to the mixed state. The essential point of the method is the registration of the electromagnetic radiation from the superconductor at zero magnetic field caused by the acoustic Stewart-Tolman effect. © EDP Sciences.},

abstract={We have measured the amplitude and the phase of an electromagnetic (EM) field radiated from a superconductor (amorphous ZrTiCuNiBe alloy) in the mixed state due to the interaction of the flux lattice with an elastic wave. The results point to an essential contribution of a surface pinning into the flux lattice dynamics. We propose a model that describes radiation of the EM field from superconductors with nonuniform pinning. The model allows us to reconstruct the viscosity and the Labusch parameters from the experimental data. The behavior of the Labusch parameter can be qualitatively explained in terms of the collective pinning theory with the allowance of thermal fluctuations. ©2005 The American Physical Society.},

It is shown that the adiabatic renormalization of the coherent tunneling amplitude can explain only part of the whole effect observed in the experiment. There exists another mechanism of the renormalization affecting only nearly symmetric TLS's, which may be associated with the effect of electron density fluctuations on the interwell potential.},

abstract={The relaxation parameters of charge carriers in aluminum are measured by investigating the attenuation of electron sound and acoustic wave transfer under Doppler-shifted cyclotron resonance. It is shown that the electron-electron relaxation rate at spherical parts of the hole sheet of the Fermi surface is close to the results of the theory (A. Jaquier et al., Phys. Rev. B52, 13005 (1995)) that takes into account the electron-electron interaction with the exchange of virtual phonons. At the same time, the experimental anisotropy of the electron-electron scattering is considerably smaller than the calculated value. A noticeable anisotropy of the electron-impurity collisions frequency in aluminum is discovered. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.},

In contrast to Ga and Mo, ES amplitude in the superconducting state of Al increases sharply just below Tc.

abstract={We develop a new method of investigation of low-temperature electron relaxation \in metals, based on the analysis of the temperature dependences of the attenuation of zero sound excited by ultrasonic pulses. We have discovered that these dependences obtained in the temperature region about of 1-8 K reproduce directly the temperature behavior of the electron scattering rate. The main features of our method are its insensitivity to small-angle scattering and the additivity of contributions of various relaxation processes to the total scattering rate. Both the theoretical analysis of zero-sound propagation in various damping regimes and special experiments produced for gallium confirm the validity of our consideration. We have identified the considerable contribution of electron-electron collisions in all investigated metals (gallium, aluminum, molybdenum, and tungsten) in the whole studied temperature interval and established the dominating role of Umklapp processes in the zero-sound damping at T >- 4 K for gallium and most probably for tungsten. We interpret the latter result as the first experimental observation of Peierls' exponent in polyvalent metals in zero magnetic field. The values obtained for electron-electron and electron-phonon scattering rates are compared with known experimental data and theoretical estimations. © 1993 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

abstract={The experimental results are given of investigations of nonlinear effects in the absorption of sound in superconductors. The analysis carried out shows that the data obtained cannot be explained without taking into consideration the concept of increase of the energy gap of the superconductor under the action of high-powered ultrasonic pumping. The applicability of the various mechanisms of stimulation are discussed for explaining the observed nonlinearity.},
