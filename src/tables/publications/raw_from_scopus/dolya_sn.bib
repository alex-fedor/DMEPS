abstract={Exchange bias (EB) phenomena have been observed in Nd2/3Ca 1/3MnO3 colossal magnetoresistance perovskite below the Curie temperature TC ∼ 70 K and attributed to an antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic (FM) spontaneous phase segregated state of this compound. Field cooled magnetic hysteresis loops exhibit shifts toward negative direction of the magnetic field axis. The values of exchange field H EB and coercivity HC are found to be strongly dependent of temperature and strength of the cooling magnetic field Hcool. These effects are attributed to evolution of the FM phase content and a size of FM clusters. A contribution to the total magnetization of the system due to the FM phase has been evaluated. The exchange bias effect decreases with increasing temperature up to TC and vanishes above this temperature with disappearance of FM phase. Relaxation of a non-equilibrium magnetic state of the compound manifests itself through a training effect also observed while studying EB in Nd2/3Ca1/3MnO3. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract={Magnetic dipoles are accelerated by a running gradient of the magnetic field that is produced by sequentially energizing current-carrying turns. Magnetic dipoles dsh = 60 mm in diameter and ltot = 1 m in length are gasdynamically preaccelerated to velocity Vin = 1 km/s, with which they are injected into the main accelerator. The turnover of the dipoles in the field of an accelerating pulse is prevented and focusing of dipoles is provided by directing the dipoles into a titanium tube. The weight of the dipoles is m = 2 kg, and they acquire final velocity Vfin = 5 km/s over acceleration length Lacc = 300 m. © 2014, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

abstract={A detailed study of the low-temperature magnetic state and the relaxation in the phase-separated colossal magnetoresistance Nd 2/3Ca 1/3MnO 3 perovskite has been carried out. Clear experimental evidence of the cluster-glass magnetic behavior of this compound has been revealed. Well defined maxima in the in-phase linear ac susceptibility χ′(T) were observed, indicative of the magnetic glass transition at T g∼60 K. Strongly divergent zero-field-cooled and field-cooled static magnetizations and frequency dependent ac susceptibility are evident of the glassy-like magnetic state of the compound at low temperatures. The frequency dependence of the cusp temperature T max of the χ′(T) susceptibility was found to follow the critical slowing down mechanism. The Cole-Cole analysis of the dynamic susceptibility at low temperature has shown extremely broad distribution of relaxation times, indicating that spins are frozen at macroscopic time scale. Slow relaxation in the zero-field-cooled magnetization has been experimentally revealed. The obtained results do not agree with a canonical spin-glass state and indicate a cluster glass magnetic state of the compound below T g, associated with its antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic nano-phase segregated state. It was found that the relaxation mechanisms below the cluster glass freezing temperature T g and above it are strongly different. Magnetic field up to about μ 0H∼0.4 T suppresses the glassy magnetic state of the compound. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Applied magnetic fields lead to the drop of the low temperature specific heat by more than 2 orders, which implies a large magnetic contribution. Experimental data were successfully fitted by the sum of the hyperfine C hyp, the linear T-dependent C sg and the spin waves C sw contributions. The C sg attributed to the glassy state of the magnetic systems of the studied insulating compounds exponentially decreases with the increase of H up to ∼5 T. The C sw providing the best fitting of the experimental data is attributed to the ferromagnetic spin waves with pseudo gap Δ(H) in the spin-wave spectrum which increases linearly with the increase of the applied magnetic field. The Δ(0)∼0.8 K is approximately the same for both compounds studied. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={The coherent phenomena in mesoscopic cylindrical normal metal (N) -superconductor (S) structures have been investigated theoretically. The magnetic moment (persistent current) of such a structure has been calculated numerically and (approximately) analytically. It is shown that the current in the N layer corresponding to the free-energy minimum is always diamagnetic. As the field increases, the magnetic moment (current) exhibits jumps at certain values of the trapped magnetic flux and the NS structure changes to a state with smaller absolute value of the diamagnetic moment. This occurs when the persistent current is unable to screen the external field. The magnetic moment increase stepwise and the system changes into a new stable state. The magnetic field penetrates into a larger volume of the N layer. The state has smaller absolute value of the diamagnetic moment. Experimentally, this is interpreted as the presence of a paramagnetic addition in the system (paramagnetic reentrant effect). The results obtained are in qualitative agreement with the experiments conducted by P. Visani [Phys. Rev. Lett. 65, 1514 (1990)]. © 2009 The American Physical Society.},

These subspaces, being finite dimensional, include, nonetheless, states with an infinite number of quasi-particles, corresponding to the original Bose operators. The basis functions look rather simple in the coherent state representation and are expressed in terms of the degenerate hypergeometric function with respect to the complex variable labelling the representation. In some particular degenerate cases they turn (up to the power factor) into trigonometric or hyperbolic functions, Bessel functions or combinations of the exponent and Hermite polynomials. We find explicitly the relationship between coefficients at different powers of Bose operators that ensure quasi-exact solvability of Hamiltonians.},

abstract={It is found that chemical disorder in the YbInCu4 compound (especially in the Yb sublattice) considerably affects its magnetic properties due to spatial nonuniformity of the temperature Tv of the first-order valence phase transition. The evolution of the magnetic susceptibility during disordering of the stoichiometric compound YbInCu4 is described by the model expression taking into account the Tv dispersion upon the application of pressure and variation of composition of YbIn1- xAgxCu4 solid mixtures. The behavior of the main parameters of the system masked by blurring of the magnetic susceptibility singularity for a disordered sample during phase transition. Among other things, the value of the derivative dTv/dx=203 K is determined. The reason behind an abrupt change in the concentration dependence of dispersion and the paramagnetic Curie temperature is calculated at xc≃0.25. © 1999 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={It is found that the chemical disorder in the compound YbInCu4 , especially in the Yb sublattice, influences significantly its magnetic properties because of the spatial inhomogeneity of the temperature of the first-order valence phase transition. Taking into account the dispersion TV in the model expression for susceptibility, its evolution is described during disordering of the stoichiometric compound YbInCu4 , under applied pressure and in varied compositions of the solid YbIn1-x AgxCu4 solutions. The behavior of the basic parameters of the system masked by the smearing of the magnetic susceptibility feature in a disordered sample during the phase transition has been detected and explained. In particular, the value of the derivative dTV/dx = 203 K is estimated. The sharp change in the concentration dependence of dispersion and the paramagnetic Curie temperature at xc = 0.2 is discussed.},
