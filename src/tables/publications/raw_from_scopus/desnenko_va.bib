abstract={Magnetic behavior of CoII(n)AlIII layered double hydroxides (LDHs) (n=Co/Al=2 and 3) intercalated with nitrate was studied as a function of temperature. Both LDH compounds are paramagnetic above about 8K. A rapid increase of their magnetic moments occurs below this temperature until the moments reach the maximum values at Tmax of 4.0K and 3.2K for Co(2)Al-NO3 and Co(3)Al-NO3, respectively. Below Tmax, the zero-field-cooled and the field-cooled static magnetization curves are strongly different. Along with this low-temperature phenomena, Co(2)Al-NO3 and Co(3)Al-NO3 demonstrate anomalous behavior of their temperature dependence magnetic susceptibility in a highertemperature range: between 75 and 175K, both the paramagnetic Curie temperature and the effective magnetic moment change in a non-monotonous way. Possible structural reasons of the observed magnetic behavior of the CoII(n)AlIII LDHs are discussed.},

abstract={Magnetic and thermodynamic properties of polycrystalline multiferroic Bi0.65La0.35Fe0.5Sc0.5O3 synthesized under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions are reported. Magnetic properties were studied using a SQUID magnetometer technique over the temperature range of 5−300 K in magnetic fields up to H=10 kOe. The field dependent magnetization M(H) was measured in magnetic fields up to 50 kOe at different temperatures up to 230 K after zero-field cooling procedure. A long-range magnetic ordering of the AFM type with a weak FM contribution occurs below the Néel temperature TN ~237 K. Magnetic hysteresis loops taken below TN show a huge coercive field up to Hc ~10 kOe. A strong effect of magnetic field on the magnetic properties of the compound has been found. Derivative of the initial magnetization curves demonstrates a temperature-dependent anomaly in fields of H=15−25 kOe. Besides, an anomaly of the temperature dependent zero-field cooled magnetization measured in magnetic fields of 6−7 kOe has been found. Origin of both anomalies is associated with inhomogeneous magnetic state of the compound. The heat capacity has been measured from 2 K up to room temperature and a significant contribution from the magnon excitations at low temperatures has been detected. From the low-temperature heat capacity, an anisotropy gap of the magnon modes of the order 3.7 meV and Debye temperature TD=189 K have been determined. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The evolution of magnetic and electric properties of the narrow-band manganite Nd2/3Ca1/3MnO3 was studied by the electron-spin resonance (ESR), static magnetic field (dc) and resistivity techniques in the temperature range of 100-380 K. It was found that below the charge ordering temperature, TCO≈212 K, the compound is a mixture of the charge ordered and charge disordered phases in varying proportions depending on the temperature. The exchange phase process, when the amount of the charge ordered phase increases under cooling, while the amount of the charge disordered phase decreases is the most intense between ∼220 K and 180 K. At low temperatures, T&lt;160 K, the charge ordered to the charge disordered phase ratio is about 4:1, which is in excellent agreement with previous neutron diffraction data. Both a sharp decrease of the magnetic susceptibility and a huge resistivity increase are evident of the weakening of ferromagnetic correlations and suppression of the double exchange interaction across the charge ordering due to the localization of the charge carriers. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={A 20% substitution of Bi with La in the perovskite Bi1-xLaxFe0.5Sc0.5O3 system obtained under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions has been found to induce an incommensurately modulated structural phase. The room-temperature x-ray and neutron powder diffraction patterns of this phase were successfully refined using the Imma(0,0,γ)s00 superspace group (γ=0.534(3)) with the modulation applied to Bi/La and oxygen displacements. The modulated structure is closely related to the prototype antiferroelectric structure of PbZrO3 which can be considered as the lock-in variant of the latter with γ=0.5. Below TN∼220 K, the neutron diffraction data provide evidence for a long-range G-type antiferromagnetic ordering commensurate with the average Imma structure. Based on a general symmetry consideration, we show that the direction of the spins is controlled by the antisymmetric exchange imposed by the two primary structural distortions, namely oxygen octahedral tilting and incommensurate atomic displacements. The tilting is responsible for the onset of a weak ferromagnetism, observed in magnetization measurements, whereas the incommensurate displacive mode is dictated by the symmetry to couple a spin-density wave. The obtained results demonstrate that antisymmetric exchange is the dominant anisotropic interaction in Fe3+-based distorted perovskites with a nearly quenched orbital degree of freedom. © 2015 American Physical Society.},

abstract={Neutron powder diffraction measurements on the 35 % La-substituted Bi1-xLaxFe0.5Sc0.5O3 composition revealed that the samples obtained under high-pressure (6 GPa) and higherature (1500 K) conditions crystalize into a distorted perovskite structure with the orthorhombic Pnma symmetry and the unit cell parameters: ao = 5.6745(2) Å, bo = 7.9834(3) Å and co = 5.6310(2) Å. A long-range magnetic ordering takes place below 220 K and implies a G-type magnetic structure with the moments 4.10(4)μB per Fe aligned predominately along the orthorhombic c-axis. The space group representation theory using the orthorhombic symmetry yields four bi-linear coupling schemes for the magnetic order parameters imposed by antisymmetric exchange interactions. The couplings are analysed based on symmetry adapted distortion modes defined in respect of the undistorted cubic perovskite structure. The approach allows a quantitative estimation of the coupling strength. It is shown that the experimentally found spin configuration combines the magnetic order parameters coupled by the atomic displacement modes with the largest amplitudes. The results indicate that the antisymmetric exchange is the dominant anisotropic term which fully controls the direction of the Fe3+ spins in the distorted perovskite lattice. © 2015 by De Gruyter.},

In sufficiently high magnetic fields, Hcool &gt; 5 kOe, the HEB value is approximately twice in the doped compound than in the parent compound. This difference is attributed to the lower exchange interaction and the higher saturation magnetization of the ferromagnetic phase in (Nd0.9Y0.1)2/3Ca1/3MnO3.},

abstract={Exchange bias (EB) phenomena have been observed in Nd2/3Ca 1/3MnO3 colossal magnetoresistance perovskite below the Curie temperature TC ∼ 70 K and attributed to an antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic (FM) spontaneous phase segregated state of this compound. Field cooled magnetic hysteresis loops exhibit shifts toward negative direction of the magnetic field axis. The values of exchange field H EB and coercivity HC are found to be strongly dependent of temperature and strength of the cooling magnetic field Hcool. These effects are attributed to evolution of the FM phase content and a size of FM clusters. A contribution to the total magnetization of the system due to the FM phase has been evaluated. The exchange bias effect decreases with increasing temperature up to TC and vanishes above this temperature with disappearance of FM phase. Relaxation of a non-equilibrium magnetic state of the compound manifests itself through a training effect also observed while studying EB in Nd2/3Ca1/3MnO3. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract={A detailed magnetization study for the novel FeSe superconductor is carried out to investigate the behavior of the intrinsic magnetic susceptibility χ in the normal state with temperature and under hydrostatic pressure. The temperature dependences of χ and its anisotropy Δχ = χ- χ are measured for FeSe single crystals in the temperature range 4.2-300 K, and a substantial growth of susceptibility with temperature is revealed. The observed anisotropy Δχ is very large and comparable to the averaged susceptibility at low temperatures. For a polycrystalline sample of FeSe, the significant pressure effect on χ is determined to be essentially dependent on temperature. Ab initio calculations of the pressure-dependent electronic structure and magnetic susceptibility indicate that FeSe is close to magnetic instability, with dominating enhanced spin paramagnetism. The calculated paramagnetic susceptibility exhibits a strong dependence on the unit cell volume and especially on the height Z of chalcogen species from the Fe plane. The change of Z under pressure determines a large positive pressure effect on χ, which is observed at low temperatures. It is shown that the literature experimental data on the strong and nonmonotonic pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature in FeSe correlate qualitatively with the calculated behavior of the density of electronic states at the Fermi level. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={We have studied by the electron-spin resonance (ESR) and static magnetic field techniques, the La 2/3Ba 1/3MnO 3 perovskite, which was previously shown to exhibit a martensitic phase transformation in the vicinity of T s∼200 K [Physical Review B 68, 054109 (2003)], leading to its structural phase-segregated state. Resonant absorptions reveal that in the temperature interval from 100 K to 340 K the compound represents a mixture of two ferromagnetic phases possessing different magnetizations, in varying proportions depending on the temperature, and a small amount of a paramagnetic phase. The results agree well with the previous neutron diffraction study. Applied in the ESR experiments, magnetic fields (2-6 kOe) strongly affect the magnetization curves: even magnetic field as high as 700 Oe modifies the anomaly in the phase transformation region and removes the difference between the zero-field cooled and field-cooled magnetization curves, which implies that the difference in the magnetic susceptibility of the coexisting phases is small and the magnetic domain configuration can be easily changed. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Magnetization studies were carried out for the novel FeSe 1-xTe x superconductors (0≤x≤1) to investigate a behavior of the intrinsic magnetic susceptibility χ in the normal state. The magnetic susceptibility was found to increase gradually with Te content. The temperature dependencies of the magnetic susceptibility χ and its anisotropy Δχ= χ∥- χ⊥ were measured for FeSe in the temperature range 4.2-300 K, and a growth of susceptibility with temperature was revealed. For FeTe a substantial increase of χ under pressure was found. Ab initio calculations of the band structure and magnetic susceptibility have shown, that FeSe 1-xTe x systems are close to magnetic instability with dominating enhanced spin paramagnetism. The calculated paramagnetic susceptibility exhibits a strong dependence on the unit cell volume V and especially the height of chalcogen species from the Fe plane. With appropriate values of these parameters the calculations have reproduced the experimental data on χ(T) and χ(P) for FeSe and FeTe, respectively. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A detailed study of the low-temperature magnetic state and the relaxation in the phase-separated colossal magnetoresistance Nd 2/3Ca 1/3MnO 3 perovskite has been carried out. Clear experimental evidence of the cluster-glass magnetic behavior of this compound has been revealed. Well defined maxima in the in-phase linear ac susceptibility χ′(T) were observed, indicative of the magnetic glass transition at T g∼60 K. Strongly divergent zero-field-cooled and field-cooled static magnetizations and frequency dependent ac susceptibility are evident of the glassy-like magnetic state of the compound at low temperatures. The frequency dependence of the cusp temperature T max of the χ′(T) susceptibility was found to follow the critical slowing down mechanism. The Cole-Cole analysis of the dynamic susceptibility at low temperature has shown extremely broad distribution of relaxation times, indicating that spins are frozen at macroscopic time scale. Slow relaxation in the zero-field-cooled magnetization has been experimentally revealed. The obtained results do not agree with a canonical spin-glass state and indicate a cluster glass magnetic state of the compound below T g, associated with its antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic nano-phase segregated state. It was found that the relaxation mechanisms below the cluster glass freezing temperature T g and above it are strongly different. Magnetic field up to about μ 0H∼0.4 T suppresses the glassy magnetic state of the compound. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The magnetic properties of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) modified with cobalt nanoparticles were studied in the temperatures and magnetic field range of (4.2-290) K and (0.03-5) T, respectively. Nanoparticles of cobalt encapsulated inside MWCNTs were obtained by using the chemical vapor deposition technique. The low temperature SQUID magnetization measurements were supplemented with structural investigations by means of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy as well as thermogravimetric and X-ray diffraction analysis. X-ray diffraction revealed the presence of MWCNTs, f.c.c. Co and h.c.p. Co phases. The magnetic characterization provided the remanent magnetization value (MR) of about 0.07 emu/g (∼40% of the saturation moment), while the coercive field (HC) value amounts to 600 Oe. Both parameters MR and HC slightly decrease with the rise of temperature. The substantial magnetization increase observed at low temperatures suggests the existence of nano Co clusters (in the atomic scale size). © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The low temperature specific heat and magnetic characteristics of Nd 2/3Ca1/3MnO3 perovskite are studied in a wide range of magnetic fields (up to 9 T). Temperature dependent specific heat data show a broadened Schottky-like anomaly below 20 K caused by splitting of the Nd3 ions ground-state doublet in the effective molecular field H ex, determined by exchange interaction between Nd and Mn spin systems supplemented by an applied external magnetic field. Existence of the splitting at zero magnetic field and expressed field dependence is the evidence of a strong exchange coupling between Nd and Mn magnetic subsystems. The Nd-ions magnetic ordering leads to an additional contribution to the magnetic moment of the system below 30 K, producing anomalies of the magnetic loss and field-cooled and zero-field-cooled magnetizations. The observed broadened Schottky-like anomalies are fitted for each applied magnetic field by the sum of three Schottky functions. Applied magnetic field extends the anomaly region and shifts it to higher temperatures. Splitting of the higher crystal field Kramers doublets gives an additional contribution to the heat capacity in magnetic fields. The ground state doublet g-factors g|| and g⊥ were estimated to be 3.4 and 2.2, respectively, and Hex was estimated to be 9 T. The Nd3 ions magnetic moment estimated from the magnetization data agrees with the value obtained from the specific heat data. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The magnetic susceptibility χ of FeTex compounds () was studied under hydrostatic pressure up to 2kbar at fixed temperatures of 55, 78 and 300K. Measurements were taken both for polycrystalline and single crystalline samples. At ambient pressure, with decreasing temperature a drastic drop in χ(T) was confirmed at K, which appears to be closely related to antiferromagnetic ordering. The obtained results have revealed a puzzling growth of susceptibility under pressure, and this effect is enhanced by lowering the temperature. To shed light on the pressure effects in the magnetic properties of FeTe, abinitio calculations of its volume dependent band structure and the exchange enhanced paramagnetic susceptibility were performed within the local spin density approximation. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Applied magnetic fields lead to the drop of the low temperature specific heat by more than 2 orders, which implies a large magnetic contribution. Experimental data were successfully fitted by the sum of the hyperfine C hyp, the linear T-dependent C sg and the spin waves C sw contributions. The C sg attributed to the glassy state of the magnetic systems of the studied insulating compounds exponentially decreases with the increase of H up to ∼5 T. The C sw providing the best fitting of the experimental data is attributed to the ferromagnetic spin waves with pseudo gap Δ(H) in the spin-wave spectrum which increases linearly with the increase of the applied magnetic field. The Δ(0)∼0.8 K is approximately the same for both compounds studied. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={A study of the low field magnetization and specific heat in magnetic fields up to 9 T of Nd2/3Ca1/3MnO3 perovskite in the 2-30 K temperature range has been done. All the specific heat data show broadened Schottky-like anomaly below 20 K. We suppose that such a behavior originates from the Nd magnetic ordering caused by the splitting of the Nd 3+ ions ground-state doublet (GSD) in the effective molecular field Hex of Mn spin system supplemented by an applied external magnetic field. The zero field GSD splitting is an evidence of a strong exchange coupling between Nd and Mn magnetic subsystems. The Nd-ions magnetic ordering introduces an additional contribution to the ferromagnetic moment producing anomalies of the field-cooled and zero-field-cooled magnetizations of the system below 28 K. The broadened Schottky-like anomalies found are fitted for every field by a set of three Schottky functions. Applied magnetic field extends the anomaly region and shifts it to the higher temperatures. Splitting of the higher crystal field Kramers doublets gives an additional contribution to the heat capacity under magnetic fields. The GSD g-factors g|| and g⊥ was estimated as 3.4 and 2.2, respectively, and Hex as 9 T. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The shifts of the magnetic and charge ordering transition temperatures caused by Nd substitution for Y in Nd2/3Ca1/3MnO3 CMR narrow-band perovskite manganite have been studied. At low temperatures, three different long-range magnetic orderings consistent with a phase separation scenario have been observed in the doped compound (Nd0.9Y0.1)2/3Ca1/3MnO3 by neutron-diffraction study: the antiferromagnetic orderings of PCE and DE types existing below ∼110 and ∼60 K, respectively, and the ferromagnetic one of B type existing below ∼42. Magnetic phase transformations temperatures as well as those of charge ordering have been found to be structural-dependent. Y-doping leads to the decrease of the anisotropy of the orthorhombic Pnma crystal lattice b/√2c, which causes a decrease of the indirect exchange parameters in the system and thus a decrease in the magnetic transformation temperatures for 20-30 K in the doped compound. Doping leads as well to the higher level of the coherent Jahn-Teller distortions of the MnO6 octahedra in the 200-300 K temperature region, which results in the increase of the charge ordering temperature for ∼80 K. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Three different types of long-range magnetic order co-exist in (Nd 0.9Y0.1)2/3Ca1/3MnO3 at low temperatures (as it was earlier found in Nd2/3Ca 1/3MnO3): the antiferromagnetic orderings of PCE and DE types existing below ∼110 K and ∼60 K, respectively, and the ferromagnetic one of B type existing below ∼42 K. Charge ordering occurs at 290 K in the doped compound. Diluting of Nd subsystem by Y in the parent perovskite has opposite effects on the temperatures of magnetic and charge orderings: the temperatures of all magnetic transformations are reduced in the doped compound by 20-30 K, while the charge ordering one increases by ∼80 K.

abstract={The temperature dependences of the long diagonals dMn-O of the Mn O6 octahedron and the magnetic susceptibility of Nd23 Ca13 Mn O3 in the temperature interval 100-290 K are investigated. The functions dMn-O (T) and (T) are found to have anomalies in the charge-ordering range (Tco ≈212 K). The sharp decrease of the diagonal dMn-O2s agrees with phase-transition notions, according to which the spatial modulation of the charge density is due to the modulation of the Mn-Mn bond lengths. The most likely driving forces of the transition are the Peierls lattice instability and Jahn-Teller stability of the Mn O6 octahedron at the Mn3+ ions. The hysteresis of the temperature dependence (T) in the paramagnetic region shows indirectly that structural phase separation occurs together with the transition. The parameters of the function (T) indicate that ferromagnetic clusters consisting of one, two, or three ion pairs Mn3+ - Mn4+ form in the system in the temperature intervals 274 K≤T≤290 K, 224 K≤T≤252 K, and 130 K≤T≤198 K, respectively. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={Temperature dependences of the MnO6 octahedron diagonal lengths dMn-O and magnetic susceptibility χ of Nd2/3Ca 1/3MnO3 have been studied in the temperature interval 100-290 K. Anomalies of the functions dMn-O(T) and χ(T) in the charge ordering region(Tco ≈ 212K)are revealed. The sharp decrease of the dMn-O2s diagonal is in accordance with ideas on the phase transition, by which the charge density space modulation is due to the Mn-Mn bond length modulation. The Peierls lattice instability and the Jahn-Teller instability of the MnO6 octahedrons with the Mn3+ ions are the most probable driving forces of the transition. The extended hysteresis of the χ(T) dependence in the paramagnetic region is indirect evidence that the transition is accompanied by the structural phase segregation. The parameters of the χ(T) dependence indicate the formation of the ferromagnetic clusters in the system, which consist of one, two, or three pairs of Mn 3+-Mn4+ ions in the temperature intervals 274 K ≤ T ≤ 290 K, 224 K ≤ T ≤ 252 K, and 130 K ≤ T ≤ 198 K, respectively.},

abstract={The temperature dependence of the magnitude of the weak ferromagnetic moment is measured in the many-sublattice antiferromagnetic magnetoelectric crystal LiCoPO4. The dependence is found to be nonmonotonic - as the temperature is decreased below the Néel temperature TN, the ferromagnetic moment initially increases and then decreases markedly. It reaches its highest value, close to 0.12 G, at a temperature of around 10.5 K, which is roughly TN/2. The possible mechanisms for the appearance of weak ferromagnetism in LiCoPO4 and the causes of the nonmonotonic temperature dependence of the spontaneous magnetic moment are discussed. Among the possible mechanisms, there is a preference for one in which the weak ferromagnetism is due to a nonuniform antiferromagnetic structure which is proposed for this crystal. © 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={The static magnetization MN and dynamic magnetic susceptibility χac of polycrystalline manganite La0.66Ba 0.34MnO3 are investigated in the temperature region 5K&lt;T&lt;350K. Measurements are made on a sample with a demagnetizing factor N=5.4 in static magnetic fields H in the range 0-120 Oe and on a toroidal sample with N=0 in fields with frequencies of 120 and 1000 Hz and amplitudes from 8×10-3 to 4.1 Oe. The effect of a uniaxial pressure P=0.1kbar on the static susceptibility χN=MN/H is investigated in the region 5K&lt;T&lt;270K. It is found that in the magnetically ordered state (below 314 K) χac is independent of the field amplitude in the interval 1.5-4.1 Oe and independent of temperature between 250 and 302 K. At a temperature Tp=250K a second-order phase transition (discontinuity of the derivative ∂χac/∂T) is observed, and at T i=177.5K - a first-order phase transition (discontinuity of χac(T)). The uniaxial pressure leads to an anomalous lowering of the susceptibility in the region 160-250 K with a sharp minimum at 200 K.

The measurements are carried out on a sample with demagnetization factor N = 5.4 in static magnetic field H between 0 and 120 Oe, and on a toroidal sample with N = 0 in fields of a frequency of 120 and 1000 Hz and of an amplitude of 8.10-3-4.1 Oe, respectively. The effect of uniaxial pressure P = 0.1 kbar on static susceptibility χN = MN/H is studied in a region 5 K &lt; T &lt; 270 K. It is found that in the magnetically ordered state (below 314 K) the χac value does not depend on magnetic field amplitude in an interval 1.5-4.1 Oe and on temperature between 250 and 302 K. At the temperature Tp = 250 K a second order phase transition was found (a break in the ∂χac/∂T derivative), while at the Ti =177.5 K it was a first order one (a break in the χac(T) dependence). The uniaxial pressure results in an abnormal decrease of the susceptibility in the range 160-250 K with an acute mimimum at 200 K. The temperature and field dependences of the magnetic susceptibility outside the phase transitions region were interpreted using the concepts of the formation of a helical magnetic structure in the system in weak fields below the 302 K.},

abstract={The magnetization M(T) and electrical resistivity ρ(T) of a La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 film have been studied in the temperature range 5 K ≤ T ≤ 320 K in the magnetic field intervals 10 Oe ≤ H ≤ 400 Oe and 0 ≤ H ≤ 50 kOe, respectively. It is found that the M(T)/M(0) value is larger than that predicted by the conventional molecular field model below the Curie point T = 267 K, and that the In ρ(T) dependence is close to linear in the temperature range 80 K &lt; T &lt; 200 K (accordingly, ∂ ln ρ/∂T is constant in this region). A model of the electrical conductivity and magnetoresistivity of the system describing qualitatively the experimental results is proposed (the Δmτ model). The model includes a thermally activated (with characteristic energy Δ) mechanism of conductivity, dependence of the concentration and the effective mass (m) of the itinerant charge carriers on the magnetization, as well as scattering (with characteristic time τ) of the charge carriers by static breakings of the translational symmetry, thermal fluctuations of the magnetic order, and phonons.},
