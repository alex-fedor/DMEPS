The experimental results are supplemented by theoretical calculations of the volume dependent electronic structure of SmS and orbital magnetism of the band electronic states χVV(band).

abstract={A theoretical and experimental study of the electron structure and nature of the chemical bonds in FeTe compounds in antiferromagnetic (AFM) and paramagnetic phases. It is established that the nature of the chemical bonds is mainly metallic, and the presence of covalent bonds Fe-Te and Te-Te helps to stabilize the structural distortions of the tetragonal phase of FeTe in the low-temperature region. It is found that the bicollinear AFM structure corresponds to the ground state of the FeTe compound and the calculated value of the magnetic moment MFe = -2.4μB is in good agreement with the data from neutron diffraction measurements. At the same time, the Fermi surface (FS) of the low-temperature AFM phase is radically different from the FS of the paramagnetic FeTe. Reconstructing the FS can lead to a sign change of the Hall coefficient observed in FeTe. The calculation results serve as evidence of the fact that the electron structures and magnetic properties of FeTe are well-described by the model of itinerant d-electrons and the density functional theory (DFT-GGA). © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract={The temperature dependence and the effect of pressure P up to 2 kbar on the magnetic susceptibility χ of the tetraborides SmB4 and YbB4 was studied. For the compound CeB4, the electronic structure and magnetic susceptibility were calculated from first principles as a function of the atomic volume.

In particular, the obtained pressure derivatives of susceptibility dlnχ/dP for cerium, samarium and ytterbium tetraborides are -2, -0.6 and +2.7 (in units of Mbar-1), respectively, which are characteristic for the exchange-enhanced itinerant paramagnetism, Van Vleck ionic paramagnetism with a stable f-shell, and the magnetism of rare-earth ions in the intermediate valence state. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.},

Predominantly, metal character of chemical bonds in FeTe compound is established, and the presence of covalent bonds between Fe-Te and Te-Te atoms provides stabilization of structural distortions of the tetragonal phase at low temperatures. It is established that double stripe AFM phase corresponds to the ground state of FeTe compound, and the calculated value of magnetic moment MFe = 2,4μB is in agreement with the results of neutron diffraction measurements. At the same time, the Fermi surface (FS) of low-temperature AFM phase substantially differs from FS of paramagnetic FeTe. Fermi surfase reconstruction at AFM transition can produce a sign change of the Hall coefficient which was observed in FeTe. Results of the calculations demonstrate that electronic structure and magnetic properties of FeTe are well described within the itinerant d-electrons approach and the density functional theory (DFT-GGA).},

abstract={The magnetic properties of Fe1+yTe single crystals (y≃ 0.10.18) were studied at temperatures 4.2300K. At an ambient pressure, with decreasing temperature a drastic drop in χ(T) was confirmed at T≃ 6065K, which appears to be closely related to the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering. It is found that the magnitudes of the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility Δχ in the AFM phase are close in the studied samples, whereas the sign of the anisotropy apparently depends on the small variations of the excess iron y in Fe1+yTe samples. The performed DFT calculations of the electronic structure and magnetic properties for the stoichiometric FeTe compound indicate the presence of frustrated AFM ground states. There are very close energies and magnetic moments for the double stripe configurations, with the AFM axes oriented either on the basal plane or along the [0 0 1] direction. Presumably, both these configurations can be realized in Fe1+yTe single crystals, depending on the variations of the excess iron. This can provide different signs of magnetic anisotropy in the AFM phase, presently observed in the Fe1+yTe samples. For these types of AFM configuration, the calculations for the FeTe values of Δχ are consistent with our experimental data. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The effect of isotropic pressures P up to 5 kbar on the superconducting transition temperature T<inf>c</inf> of the FeSe<inf>1-x</inf>Te<inf>x</inf> system (x=0, 0.85, 0.88, 0.90) is studied. For the first time, a change in the sign of the effect of pressure on T<inf>c</inf> on going from FeSe to the tellurium-rich alloys is observed. This makes it possible to specify more precisely the form of the dependence of the pressure derivative dT<inf>c</inf>/dP on composition in this system. This dependence is compared with first principles calculations of the electron structure and magnetism of FeSe, FeTe, and FeSe<inf>0.5</inf>Te<inf>0.5</inf> as functions of pressure, as well as with our earlier experimental data on the effect of pressure on the magnetic susceptibility of the normal state in FeSe and FeTe. This comparison is indicative of a competitive interrelationship between superconductivity and magnetism in tellurium rich FeSe<inf>1-x</inf>Te<inf>x</inf> compounds. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract={A detailed magnetization study for the novel FeSe superconductor is carried out to investigate the behavior of the intrinsic magnetic susceptibility χ in the normal state with temperature and under hydrostatic pressure. The temperature dependences of χ and its anisotropy Δχ = χ- χ are measured for FeSe single crystals in the temperature range 4.2-300 K, and a substantial growth of susceptibility with temperature is revealed. The observed anisotropy Δχ is very large and comparable to the averaged susceptibility at low temperatures. For a polycrystalline sample of FeSe, the significant pressure effect on χ is determined to be essentially dependent on temperature. Ab initio calculations of the pressure-dependent electronic structure and magnetic susceptibility indicate that FeSe is close to magnetic instability, with dominating enhanced spin paramagnetism. The calculated paramagnetic susceptibility exhibits a strong dependence on the unit cell volume and especially on the height Z of chalcogen species from the Fe plane. The change of Z under pressure determines a large positive pressure effect on χ, which is observed at low temperatures. It is shown that the literature experimental data on the strong and nonmonotonic pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature in FeSe correlate qualitatively with the calculated behavior of the density of electronic states at the Fermi level. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The dc paramagnetic susceptibility of Gd was measured in the temperature range 295-365 K and under hydrostatic pressure up to 0.16 GPa, yielding values of the paramagnetic Curie temperature Θ and its pressure derivative. Based on the results of ab initio electronic structure calculations, the experimental behavior of Θ under hydrostatic pressure together with the literature data on the uniform and uniaxial pressure effects was examined within a mean-field like approach. For this purpose, the effective d-band susceptibility and the relevant exchange integrals were calculated as functions of the lattice parameters within the density functional theory. These calculations provided a reasonable description of the experimentally observed uniform pressure effect, but a less satisfactory description of the uniaxial pressure effect. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The magnetic susceptibility χ of FeTex compounds () was studied under hydrostatic pressure up to 2kbar at fixed temperatures of 55, 78 and 300K. Measurements were taken both for polycrystalline and single crystalline samples. At ambient pressure, with decreasing temperature a drastic drop in χ(T) was confirmed at K, which appears to be closely related to antiferromagnetic ordering. The obtained results have revealed a puzzling growth of susceptibility under pressure, and this effect is enhanced by lowering the temperature. To shed light on the pressure effects in the magnetic properties of FeTe, abinitio calculations of its volume dependent band structure and the exchange enhanced paramagnetic susceptibility were performed within the local spin density approximation. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The R(T) dependence near T N reveals a kink related to the enhancement of sample's conductivity upon the transition from the antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic state. With an increase in temperature far above T N, the transition from the dielectric (dR/dT &lt; 0) to metal (dR/dT &gt; 0) occurs. The observed behavior of resistance is attributed to delocalization of carriers above T N. © 2011 Allerton Press, Inc.},

abstract={The temperature dependences of resistance, R (T), of two single-crystals La2 CuO4 + δ samples have been studied with the aim to detect a possible change in the R (T) behavior induced by paramagnetic-antiferromagnetic (PM-AFM) transition. One of the samples with δ ≲ 0.01, was fairly homogeneous in oxygen distribution (not phase-separated) with Néel temperature TN ≈ 266 K. Conductivity of this sample has been determined by Mott's variable-range hopping below TN. The other, far less resistive, sample with δ ≈ 0.05, was inhomogeneous (phase-separated) showing both PM-AFM (TN ≈ 205 K) and superconducting (Tc ≈ 25 K) transitions. It is found that for the homogeneous sample the resistivity decreases above TN far faster with temperature than below it (for both directions of measuring current, parallel and perpendicular to basal CuO2 planes). A similar behavior of conductivity near PM-AFM transition is also found for the phase-separated and less resistive sample. In this case a clear kink in R (T) curve near TN ≈ 205 K can be seen. Furthermore, a transition to metallic (dR / dT &gt; 0) behavior occurs far enough above TN. The observed behavior of the samples studied is related to increased delocalization of charge carriers above TN. This is in accordance with decrease in the AFM correlation length and corresponding enhancement of the hole mobility above TN known for low-doped lanthanum cuprates. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The magnetic properties of the compound LaFeAsO0.85F0.1 were investigated by measurements of the dc magnetization for different values of the magnetic field H=0.02, 1.0 and 2.0T in the temperature range 4.2-300K. Superconducting behavior was found below 26K, whereas a distinct peculiarity in the low-field dependence of the magnetic susceptibility χ(T) was clearly observed at TM≃135K, which resembles a weak ferromagnetic (FM) response with saturation magnetic moment of about 10-4μB per formula unit at 50K. The transition at TM is presumably not governed by magnetic impurities but rather correlated with the antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition in undoped LaFeAsO at about the same temperature. We suggest that the observed magnetic properties of the LaFeAsO0.85F0.1 sample are due to an interplay of FM and AFM transitions, and are presumably related with an intrinsic feature of a small portion of the undoped LaFeAsO phase inherent in our sample. In order to shed light on the problem of magnetic instability of the LaFeAsO, ab initio DFT calculations of the electronic structure and paramagnetic susceptibility were performed within the local spin density approximation. It is shown that a V-shaped peculiarity in the density of electronic states close to the Fermi level can govern magnetic properties of LaFeAsO with fluorine doping and/or oxygen deficiency. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={The pressure derivative dTC/dP was evaluated from measurements of the paramagnetic susceptibility of (U0.95Th0.05)3Al2M 3 alloys (M = Si and Ge) under uniform pressure in order to estimate the chemical pressure effect on TC. Our results show that the decrease of the unit cell volume under pressure is followed by decrease of Θ (≈TC). As it was evaluated from X-ray study, the substitution of U by Th leads to a nearly linear increase of the unit cell volume V, i.e. to negative chemical pressure effect. The chemical pressure effect appears to be of the same order as the total change of TC induced by hydrostatic pressure in these alloys but opposite in sign. The decrease of TC with alloying is presumably caused by a change of 5f state hybridization with conduction electrons. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The ultrasonic study is supported by magnetic, resistive, magnetoresistive, structural, and other measurements of the sample that facilitate interpretation of the results obtained. The magnetic-field influence on sound properties found in this study presents some interesting features of the interplay between the elastic and magnetic properties of these compounds. It is shown that the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition in the sample studied is first order, but can become second order under the influence of applied magnetic field. © 2006 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={The DC transport properties of and the radio-frequency (RF) wave absorption (at 2.525 MHz) in a sample of La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 prepared by floating-zone method are measured. The Curie temperature, T c, of the sample is about 374 K. Giant temperature and magnetic-field variations in RF absorption are found in the vicinity of Tc. Relative change of the RF absorption in magnetic field (magnetoabsorption) is about 67% in field 2.1 kOe and about 55% in field 1 kOe. This giant magnetoabsorption effect can be used to develop RF devices controlled by temperature and low magnetic field. A weak temperature dependence of magnetoabsorption for the sample studied in the range from room temperature to about 350 K makes it especially attractive for practical use. The RF study supplemented with transport, magnetoresistive and magnetic measurements enables us to discuss the optimal properties of manganite samples for observation of giant magnetoabsorption in low field. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The anisotropy of the hopping conductivity of antiferromagnetic La 2CuO4+δ single crystals with TN≈188K is investigated in the temperature range 5-295 K and the anisotropy of their magnetoresistance, in the temperature range 5-55 K. The resistance is measured by the Montgomery method for different combinations of directions of the transport current and magnetic field relative to the crystallographic axes. For the case when the field and transport current are directed parallel to the CuO2 layers, a transition from negative to positive magnetoresistance is observed when the temperature is raised to T≈20K. For fields perpendicular to the CuO2 layers, only negative magnetoresistance is observed. The nature of the positive magnetoresistance is discussed. It is shown that the effect is most likely due not to the interaction of the spin of the charge carriers with the surrounding magnetic medium but to the orbital motion of these carriers. The corresponding values of the positive magnetoresistance and its behavior as a function of magnetic field and temperature are found using the well-known model of Shklovskii and Efros, which is based on taking into account the compression of the impurity wave functions of the charge carriers in the magnetic field. © 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={The results on anisotropy of hopping conductivity (5-295 K) and magnetoresistance (MR) (5-55 K) of La2CuO4+δ antiferromagnetic single crystals with TN ≈ 188 K are reported. The resistance was measured by the Montgomery technique for different combinations of transport current and magnetic field directions with respect to the crystallographic axes. In the case where the field and transport current were parallel to the CuO2 layers, a transition (at T ≈ 20 K) from negative MR to positive MR was detected with a rise of temperature. In the fields perpendicular to the CuO2 layers, only negative MR was observed. The nature of the positive MR is discussed. It is shown that the effect is more likely attributable to the orbital motion of charge carriers rather than to the interaction of their spins with the magnetic surroundings. The correlation is found between the value, magnetic-field and temperature behavior of the positive MR and the known Shklovsky-Efros model based on the allowance for compression of impurity wave functions of charge carriers in magnetic field.},

In order to analyze the experimental magnetovolume effect, d ln χ/d ln V, the volume-dependent electronic structure of CeCo2 has been calculated ab initio by employing a relativistic full-potential LMTO method. The calculations have brought out strong hybridization of the itinerant 4f (Ce) and 3d (Co) states, which leads to a filling of the peculiar bonding band. It is demonstrated that the magnetic properties of CeCo2 are consistent with itinerant behavior of the 4f electrons of cerium. The large volume derivative of the effective electron-electron interaction parameter, d ln I/d ln V ≃ - 1.7, implies a predominant role of the short-range correlations, in accordance with the Hubbard model. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={The magnetic susceptibility of the intermetallic compounds RInCu4 (R = Gd, Er and Yb) was measured under helium gas pressure up to 2 kbar at the fixed temperatures 78, 150 and 300 K. For YbInCu4, which exhibits a first-order valence phase transition at TV ≃ 40 K, the Grüneisen parameter for the Kondo energy, ΩK ≡ -d ln TK/d ln V = -32, is large and typical for Ce-based heavy-fermion systems in magnitude but opposite in sign. The effect of atomic disorder is discussed on the basis of the data for a chemically disordered sample; the pressure effect at T = 78 K is strongly enhanced due to the spatial dispersion of pressure-sensitive TV, and hence dTV/dP = -2.0 K kbar-1 is obtained by assuming a Gaussian distribution of TV. On the basis of an extrapolation of the experimental pressure dependence, a (P, T) phase diagram is proposed for YbInCu4. Reference compounds with stable f moments, GdInCu4 and ErInCu4, show negligible pressure dependences of the susceptibility. © 1999 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The unusual non-linear effects in hopping conduction of single-crystal La2CuO4+δ with excess oxygen has been observed. The resistance is measured as a function of the applied voltage U (voltage controlled regime) in the temperature range 5 K ≤ T ≤ 300 K and voltage range 10-3-25 V. At relatively high voltage (approximately at U &gt; 0.1 V) the conduction of sample investigated corresponds well to variable-range hopping (VRH). That is, in the range 0.1 V &lt; U ≤ 1 V the conductivity does not depend on U (Ohmic behavior) and the temperature dependence of resistance R(T) follows closely the Mott's law of VRH [R ∝ exp(T0/T)1/4]. In the range of highest applied voltage the conduction has been non-Ohmic: the resistance decreases with increasing U. This non-linear effect is quite expected in the frame of VRH mechanism, since the applied electric field increases the hopping probability. A completely different and unusual conduction behavior is found, however, in the low voltage range (approximately below 0.1 V), where the influence of electric field and (or) electron heating effect on VRH ought to be neglected. Here we have observed strong increase in resistance at increasing U at T ≤20 K, whereas at T &gt; 20 K the resistance decreases with increasing U. The magnetoresistance of the sample below 20 K has been positive at low voltage and negative at high voltage. The observed unusual non-Ohmic behavior at low voltage range is attributable to inhomogeneity of the sample, namely, to the enrichment of sample surface with oxygen during the course of the heat treatment of the sample in helium and air atmosphere before measurements. At low enough temperature (below = 20 K) the surface layer with increased oxygen concentration is presumed to consist of disconnected superconducting regions in a poorly conducting (dielectric) matrix. This allows us to explain the observed unusual non-linear effects in the conduction of sample studied.

The possible cause of weak pressure dependence of the Curie point in DyCu-HoCu-TmCu series was considered and qualitatively explained on the basis of the RKKY model for magnetic moments interaction. The results obtained are in contradiction with the data for elementary REM. This fact is referred to strong anisotropy of REM crystal lattices under pressure.},
