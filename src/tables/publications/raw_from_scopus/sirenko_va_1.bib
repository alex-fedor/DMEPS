abstract={Analytical and numerical analysis was performed for an electron and phonon spectra evolution under formation of the boundary with "zigzag"-chirality. It is found an ex-citation of the wave with relativistic dispersion. The wave propagates along the boundary and decays with distance from it. The conditions of the occurrence of the wave and its properties are determined. It is shown, in particular, that the wave propagates over the atoms of sublattice, which incorporates those with bonds, broken during for-mation of the boundary. The local densities of states of the atoms of such sublattice gain sharp resonances due to gapped wave. It is found, that a formation on graphene layer of the boundary with given chirality has a similar ef-fect on the phonon modes, which are polarized normally to the layer, and the sharp resonances are formed at fre-quencies in vicinity of quasiflexural ones at quasiwave vector in the K-point of the first Brillouin zone. In this way, appearance of the "zigzag"-boundary increases both the number of charge carriers and of phonons with high group velocity, which are able to produce significant con-tribution to electron-phonon coupling.},

abstract={ABSTRACT: Measurements of Raman spectra, dielectric constant and magnetization were performed on M-type hexaferrite SrCo2Ti2Fe8O19 single crystal, which was grown by travelling solvent method in an optical furnace. The Raman spectra measurements at room temperature revealed that main Raman modes, which are associated with the bipyramid FeO5, octahedra Fe(4)O6 and Fe(5)O6 as well with mixed octahedral vibration all with A1 g symmetry, shift monotonously to higher wave numbers. In the low-frequency region (&lt;10 kHz), permittivity rapidly decreases with increasing frequency, exhibiting a typical characteristic of Maxwell-Wagner type relaxation. The relaxation peak in dielectric losses centred on 100 kHz can be attributed to ionic relaxation processes caused by multiple valence states of iron ion (Fe2+ and Fe3+). M-type hexaferrite SrCo2Ti2Fe8O19 orders magnetically at 768 K and undergoes order-to-order magnetic phase transition at 380 K. Magnetic properties are almost isotropic around room temperatures with very low hysteresis having coercive field with induction lower than 3×10−3 T and with remnant magnetization lower than 0.17 μB/f.u. for magnetic fields applied along main crystallographic directions. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

The dynamic planar stability of the considered structure is proved for temperatures above the ambient. The number of phonon states is shown to grow near the K-point of the first Brillouin zone, compared to pristine graphene. It is found, that this type of defects causes substantially non-uniform distribution of electron states and the pronounced increase in the number of states with energies close to Fermi energy can be expected in electron spectrum of the graphene-based compounds.

abstract={Phonon and electron spectra of metallic bigraphene are analyzed in the presence of step-edge crystal imperfection. Different geometries of step-edge are considered. The dynamic planar stability of the considered structure is proved for temperatures above the ambient. The number of phonon states is shown to grow near the K-point of the first Brillouin zone, compared to pristine graphene. It is found, that this type of defects causes substantially nonuniform distribution of electron states and the pronounced increase in the number of states with energies close to Fermi energy can be expected in electron spectrum of the graphene-based compounds. The performed calculations are in good agreement with inelastic neutron, x-ray and Raman measurements. © 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract={The temperature dependences of the magnetization in manganites of different composition and structural morphology were measured in two cooling regimes, field cooling (FC) and zero-field cooling (ZFC), for two different orientations of a magnetic field, parallel and perpendicular to the c-axis. The following general tendencies were found: (1) The difference between the magnetizations M<inf>FC</inf> and M<inf>ZFC</inf> at T = 5K increases with increasing magnetic field, reaching the maximum value in a magnetic field of about 2 kOe, and then drops in the range 2-5 kOe; (2) The field dependence of the "splitting" temperature T* below which the difference between the magnetizations M<inf>FC</inf> and M<inf>ZFC</inf> appears can be reasonably well described by a power law with the exponent 2/3 as predicted by the theory of spin glasses. Both results are characteristic for single crystals, as well as for ceramics and films. On the other hand, the field dependence of the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility is different for samples with different degrees of magnetic ordering (Θ/T<inf>C</inf>). These results are consistent with the detected in the present study universality of the line separating the low-temperature region of irreversibility in the H-T phase diagram of manganites. Deviations from the T*-H-line with the exponent 2/3 in strong magnetic fields, which are commonly associated with the appearance of the magnetization component transverse to the magnetic field, are typical for samples containing the antiferromagnetic phase. The interpretation takes into account the multi-phase nature of the systems, i.e., coexistence of spin glass with ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. The observed change in the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility with increasing magnetic field and the behavior of magnetic and thermomagnetic irreversibility are regarded as a manifestation of the spin-reorientation phase transition in an antiferromagnetic environment. This in turn initiates the transformation of the spin-glass-from the Ising- to the Heisenberg-type-which leads to the change in the exponent in the T*-H diagram from 2/3 to 2. The observed phenomenon is universal-it was observed in manganites of different composition and structural morphology-and represents a particular type of polyamorphism, namely, spin-glass polyamorphism. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract={The temperature variation of magnetization is con-sidered for manganites with different composition and structural morphology measured in two cooling re-gimes - in a magnetic field (FC) and without it (ZFC) at two orientations of a magnetic field - along c axis and normal to it. There are found general laws: 1) the difference between MFC and MZFC - magneti-zations at temperature T = 5 K grows with the magne-tic field increase, approaching the maximum value in a magnetic field about 2 kOe, with is followed by de-crease in a range 2-5 kOe; 2) within a magnetic-field range 0-5 kOe, The field dependence of the "splitting" temperature T*, below which the difference of MFC and MZFC magnetizations occurs, is satisfactorily de-scribed by power law with exponent 2/3, which is pre-dicted by the theory of spin glass. Both results are ty-pical as of single crystals, and of ceramics and films as well. At the same time, the field dependences of ani-sotropy of magnetic susceptibility differ for the sam-ples with different level of magnetic ordering (Θ/TC). The results agree with the found in this work univer-sality of the line, which marks the low temperature range of irreversibility at the ?-? phase diagram of manganites. Deviation of the T*-H line with exponent 2/3 in a high magnetic field, which is usually ex-plained by the appearance of a transverse to magnetic field magnetization-component, which is typical of the samples with antiferromagnetic-phase content. Consi-deration takes into account the multiphase state of the system, namely the co-existence of spin glass with fer-ro- and antiferromagnetism. The found change of ani-sotropy of magnetic susceptibility with a magnetic-field increase, peculiarities of the behavior of magnet-ic and thermo-magnetic irreversibility are considered as a manifestation of spin-reorientation phase transi-tion in antiferromagnetic medium. Eventually, it in-duces a spin-glass transformation from Ising-type to Geisenberg one, which results in the change of expo-nent at T*-H diagram from 2/3 to 2. The discovered phenomenon is universal, as it is observed for manga-nites of various composition and structure morpholo-gy, and represents the polyamorphism of some kind - the spin-glass polyamorphism.},

abstract={Published data on the temperature dependences M(T) of the magnetization of different manganites and the compound La0.8Mn1.04O3.5 are compared. The results of measurements with cooling in a magnetic field and for zero field are the same only above the splitting temperature T*. This temperature depends on the magnetic field strength at which the M(T) curves are measured. The relative change in T*, which is described by a power-law function with an exponent less than 1, as is typical of spin glass, is compared for all the ceramic samples. La0.8Mn1.04O3.5, which consists of particles with sizes of about 70 nm, is an exception. The behavior of [T*(H)-T*(0)]/T*(H) for this manganite is similar to that for a supermagnet with weak interactions. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract={The magnetic and magnetotransport properties of the anion deficient perovskites La1-xBaxCo?3-d were studied. A decrease of oxygen content is shown to be accompanied by a gradual metallic-semiconducting transition conductivity and a ferromagnetic-anti- ferromagnetic one. The highest magnetoresistance value is observed at low temperature near the concen-tration limit of the magnetic phase transition. The high magnetoresistance value is explained by the field-induced transition to a ferromagnetic phase with a higher conductivity, which occurs simultaneously with the change of spin state of the cobalt ions.},

The ordering of the oxygen vacancies leads to the appearance of a ferromagnetic component, apparently because of the formation of a noncollinear magnetic structure.

It is suggested that in the ferromagnetic oxidized compounds, the Co3+ and Co4+ ions adopt intermediate spin states, whereas in the antiferromagnetic (Co4+-free) compositions, the Co3+ ions have a high-spin state (CoO5 pyramids) with a dominant low-spin state (CoO6 octahedra).

abstract={The generation of defects in NbSe2 single crystals by electron irradiation has been investigated by a combination of ac susceptibility and structural measurements. Remarkably, thanks to the layered structure of NbSe2, we show that electronic irradiation cannot only create point defects but also in-plane extended defects, which modify anisotropically the ac response. Indeed, the analysis of the onset of the nonlinear susceptibility response, Hacl(T), as a function of irradiation dose and field orientation shows a correlated increase in the density of anisotropic defects induced by electron irradiation. Also, we measured a decrease in the strength of the pinning (Labusch) constant αL accounting for elastic vortex oscillations within the linear Campbell regime for high-dose-irradiated samples in a transverse field, again compatible with the presence of planar defects hindering vortex pinning. X-ray powder diffraction and TEM electron diffraction measurements suggest these in-plane defects may result from the rupture of Se-Se bonds and the formation of nanorods and nanowires by NbSe2 sheet rolling. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The weak ferromagnetic state due to magnetoelectric interactions was revealed in the lightly doped rhombohedrally distorted compositions. No evidence for a spontaneous magnetization was observed for the pseudo-tetragonal phases.

abstract={A direct evidence of X-ray scattering by electron modulation in a charge-density wave metal dominating over the periodic lattice distortion (PLD) is presented for hexagonal modification of niobium diselenide (2H-NbSe 2). Namely, new pronounced features appear in X-ray diffraction below TCDW indexed in the space group D3h 1 with a doubled in-plane parameter a and the inversion symmetry axis instead of screw one. Above TCDW transition, the space group D6h 4 with lattice parameters a0=3.44, c=12.8 is revealed in agreement with published data. The observed difference is due in particular to different mechanisms of neutron and X-rays scattering by spatial distribution of nuclei or electron density, respectively. A CDW formation in 2H-NbSe 2 is then accompanied by spatial modulation of electron density with periodicity 2a, manifested in X-ray scattering with a nuclei shift insufficient for neutron scattering. Indeed, numerous studies show enigmatic absence of Fermi-surface nesting in 2H-NbSe2 and, eventually, long coherence length. Within McMillan's consideration it means that in this case, electron modulation should dominate the distortion of periodic crystal potential rather than commonly observed periodic lattice distortion, e.g. in TaSe2. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The magnetostriction technique offers the advantage that quantum oscillations are particularly pronounced, which is due to pressure sensitivity of the relevant cross-section of the Fermi surface. Moreover, measurements can be performed for a field oriented along the crystallographic axis in contrast to the torque technique that is routinely used. Here we present magnetostriction measurement on a high-quality single-crystalline sample for temperatures 0.25-8.0 K using a sensitive capacitance dilatometer. Two oscillation frequencies are observed at the lowest temperatures for the in-plane orientation of the applied magnetic field. These new data reveal that the Fermi-surface sheet in the first Brillouin zone has two cross-sections, rather than the conventional pan-cake shape. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={93Nb NMR studies were carried out for a single crystal of NbSe2 at 73.328MHz in the temperature range 9-300K to investigate the normal and charge density wave (CDW) states. Detailed analysis of the NMR line shape of the central transition using a classical incommensurate model reveals the change in the conduction electron spin dynamics from above TCDW. An increase of the Knight shift below TCDW reflects modification to the uniform part of the conduction electron density of states. As suggested theoretically, the Knight shift distribution is found to be directly proportional to the square of the amplitude of the CDW. The results further indicate an incommensurate CDW state in 2H-NbSe2. Analysis of the NMR spectra using the McMillan incommensurate model suggests a large value of the discommensuration parameter (γ) which is almost temperature independent, in contrast to the much smaller value previously reported in the case of 2H-TaSe2. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The results of the study of thermodynamic properties of the anisotropic 2H-NbSe2 compound, in the superconducting to normal state (SN) upper critical field HC2-TC transition line, and in the charge density wave (CDW) transition are presented. Isothermal heat capacity and magnetization measurements were performed to determine the heat capacity jump at the HC2-TC transition line. With these results the validity of the Second Ehrenfest relation for this type II superconductor was checked. The temperature dependences of the heat capacity and the thermal expansion along the crystallographic axis s{cyrillic} were measured. Both properties manifest the sharp features of BCS-type at the superconducting transition and more diffuse features at the CDW transitions. These results, together with the First Ehrenfest relation, allowed us to estimate the critical temperature derivative on uniaxial pressure applied along the hexagonal axis s{cyrillic}, pIIs{cyrillic}, (∂ TSN / ∂ p/ / c)P → 0 = + 1.45 ± 0.05 K / GPa. The same methodology has been applied to the CDW transition, where a positive derivative on uniaxial pressure was deduced. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The intensity of x-ray scattering by the layered metal 2H-NbSe2 was studied in a temperature range below the transition to a charge density wave state. It is shown that the intensity of scattering is described by the relation I ∼ (Tc - T)-y and that y = = 1.6±.0.2 for Tc ∼ 30 K which is typical of quasi-elastic («quasi-Bragg») scattering. Such a scattering is intense for a spectral width of X-ray distribution AsXR which exceeds the spectral width of order-parameter fluctuations δεf. In the case of cold neutrons, the opposite inequality (δεn &lt;&lt; δεf) is valid and the intensity of quasi-elastic scattering is immeasurably weak.},

Irradiation affects the density of states at the Fermi surface, increasing both χp and the anisotropy. Below a threshold temperature, Ts=54 K, the paramagnetic contribution, which increases with the dose, is ascribed to dangling bonds, nanotubes and nanorods generated by irradiation.},

abstract={A study of crystal structure, elastic, and magnetic properties of low-doped Nd1-xCaxMnO3 (x ≤ 0.15) perovskites has been carried out. The ferromagnetic component is shown to increase under hole doping and, simultaneously, the temperature of the orbital order-disorder phase transition decreases. The mechanism of the concentrational transition from a weak ferromagnetic state (x = 0) to a ferromagnetic one (x &gt; 0.15) is discussed using a two-phase model, according to which the samples consist of weak ferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phases exchange coupled at their boundary. It is found that interaction between different magnetic phases leads to spin reorientation which takes place for 0.06 ≤ x ≤ 0.1 compounds around Teff ∼ 9 K. In the temperature range from 5 to 20 K, metamagnetic behaviour is revealed for the Nd0.92Ca 0.08MnO2.98 sample. H versus T as well as T versus x magnetic phase diagrams, which are characterized by the missing of a canted phase, are proposed. The appearance of orientational transitions is explained on the basis of a magnetic analogue of the Jahn-Teller effect taking into account that the magnetic moments of Nd ions are ordered parallel to the moments of Mn ions in the ferromagnetic phase, and opposite to the direction of the weak ferromagnetic vector at T &gt; Teff in the weak ferromagnetic phase.},

abstract={The influence of oxygen content on the magnetization and electrical resistivity of Ln0.5A0.5MnO3 (Ln=La, Pr, Nd; A=Ca, Ba) manganites with the perovskite structure is investigated. It is shown that the La0.5Ca0.5MnO3-γ compound undergoes a sequence of transitions from an antiferromagnetic (γ=0) to a spin-glass (γ=0.17) state and then to an inhomogeneous ferromagnetic (γ=0.3) state. A transition from an antiferromagnetic charge-ordered state to a ferromagnetic charge-disordered state in Nd0.5Ca 0.5MnO3-γ is observed as the oxygen content is reduced to where γ=0.07. The Nd0.5Ba0.5MnO 3-γ compound shows an increase of the Curie point from 110 K(γ=0) to 310 K(γ=0.3). In addition, a large magnetoresistance is revealed which develops below their Curie temperature despite the absence of Mn3+-Mn4+ pairs. A Zener double-exchange interaction is usually used in literature to explain the magnetic and electrical properties of hole-doped perovskite manganites. The data obtained support the mechanism of superexchange interactions between magnetic moments of the manganese ions via oxygen. © 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={The crystal structure of the manganite Nd0.5Sr0.5MnO3 is studied at temperatures T = 300 and 77.3 K by means of an x-ray diffractometer. It is shown that the transition from the ferromagnetic metallic state to the antiferromagnetic insulating charge-ordered state is accompanied by a lowering of the symmetry of the structure from orthorhombic to monoclinic. The space-group symmetry of the orthorhombic and monoclinic phases is identified as Imma and P21/m, respectively. Twinning of the crystal and the formation of a twin domain structure with coherent boundaries in the (00l) crystallographic planes are found.},

The magnetic flux distribution below the irreversibility line of hard superconductors is derived from both original magnetization and magnetostriction measurements and image processing.

abstract={The influence of oxygen content on the magnetization and electrical resistivity of Ln0.5A0.5MnO3 (Ln = La, Pr, Nd; A = Ca, Ba) manganites with the perovskite structure is investigated. It is shown that the La0.5Ca0.5MnO3-γ compound undergoes a sequence of transitions from an antiferromagnetic (γ = 0) to a spin-glass (γ = 0.17) state and then to an inhomogeneous ferromagnetic (γ = 0.3) state. A transition from an antiferromagnetic charge-ordered state to a ferromagnetic charge-disordered state in Nd0.5Ca0.5MnO3-γ is observed as the oxygen content is reduced to where γ = 0.07. The Nd0.5Ba0.5MnO3-γ compound shows an increase of the Curie point from 110 Κ (γ = 0) up to 310 Κ (γ = 0.3). In addition, a large magnetoresistance is revealed which develops below their Curie temperature despite the absence of Mn3+-Mn4+ pairs. A Zener double-exchange interaction is usually used in literature to explain the magnetic and electrical properties of hole-doped perovskite manganites. The data obtained support the mechanism of superexchange interactions between magnetic moments of the manganese ions via oxygen.},

A minor substitution of Mn3+ with Cr3+ (0.04 ≤ x ≤ 0.1) results in antiferromagnet - ferromagnct and insulator - metal transitions. At the Cr content x ≥ 0.1 the solid solutions become insulating and exhibit the properties of inhomogeneous ferrimagnets, where the magnetic moments of Cr and Mn ions are opposite.

abstract={This presentation reviews recently obtained results on high-temperature superconductor expansion below the superconducting transition temperature (Tsn). An original experimental set-up for control of strain effects in a magnetic field is described. Special attention is paid to magnetostriction (MS) in rigid superconductors of different types and compositions with respect to distinguished regions of their phase (BT) diagrams. The dilatometric and structural measurements are compared and treated on the basis of a developed approach, the main components of MS are estimated, and the pinning-force contribution is discussed in more detail. The study on the samples with structures varied by mechanical and heat treatment is also reported. © 1998 Academic Press Limited.},

A strong correlation between strain measurements and magnetic state of the sample was observed. The revealed peculiarities were treated in terms of superconducting order parameter formation in a heterogeneous medium with the long range elastic interactions.
