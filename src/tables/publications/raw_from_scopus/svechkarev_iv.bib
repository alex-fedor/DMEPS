abstract={The de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) effect in the anti-ferromagnetic FeGe 2 compound is studied experimen-tally. A sharp suppression of amplitude for the first harmonic of the dHvA oscillations is observed for a number of orbits on the Fermi surface of FeGe2. It is found that the conditions of the dHvA amplitude sup-pression ("spin-splitting zero") are changed for FeGe2 doped with cobalt. To analyse the experimental data we proposed a method of comprehensive calculation of conduction electron g-factors in itinerant antiferro-magnetic systems, which is based on the calculations of spin-polarized electronic structure, taking into ac-count the spin-orbit interaction, and estimated the fac-tor of exchange enhancement of spin paramagnetism in FeGe2.},

The observed dHvA frequencies range within (0.96-28.8)·102 T and the cyclotron masses range from 0.09 m0 to 0.87 m0. For ZrB2 the experimental values of electron-phonon interaction constant λ for the different sections of its Fermi surface are obtained. The λ value varies from 0.05 up to 0.16.},

abstract={The electronic structures of RB6, RB12 and RB 2C2 borides are studied ab initio by using the full-potential linear muffin-tin orbital method. This study includes the promising materials for spin electronics with reported high temperature ferromagnetism, namely, doped divalent hexaborides CaB6, SrB 6, BaB6, and the CaB2C2 compound, as well as Kondo semiconductors, SmB6 and YbB12. For CaBe and SrB6 a semiconducting band structure has been obtained, whereas a semimetallic ground state is revealed for CaB2C2 and doped hexaborides. For YB6, LaB6, CaB2C 2 and the semimetallic Ba1-xLaxB6 alloys we have performed spin-polarized band structure calculations in an external field to evaluate the induced spin and orbital magnetic moments. These calculations indicate a feasibility of the field-induced weak ferromagnetic phase in ~CaB2C2 and the La doped hexaborides. The LSDA and GGA calculations for different spin configurations of YbB12 point to a possibility of antiferromagnetic coupling between Yb3+ ions.

abstract={The magnetic susceptibility, χ, of CeCo2 compound has been measured under pressure up to 2 kbar at T = 78 and 300 K, and a pronounced pressure effect, d ln χ/dP ≃ - 5 Mbar-1, is revealed. In order to analyze the experimental magnetovolume effect, d ln χ/d ln V, the volume-dependent electronic structure of CeCo2 has been calculated ab initio by employing a relativistic full-potential LMTO method. The calculations have brought out strong hybridization of the itinerant 4f (Ce) and 3d (Co) states, which leads to a filling of the peculiar bonding band. It is demonstrated that the magnetic properties of CeCo2 are consistent with itinerant behavior of the 4f electrons of cerium. The large volume derivative of the effective electron-electron interaction parameter, d ln I/d ln V ≃ - 1.7, implies a predominant role of the short-range correlations, in accordance with the Hubbard model. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

It is found that the detailed behavior of the susceptibility cannot be explained within the framework of integer valence (Coqblin-Schrieffer model).

abstract={The magnetovolume effect, i.e., the atomic volume dependence of the magnetic susceptibility, has been investigated for the intermediate valence compound (formula presented) in the temperature range of 4.2–300 K. The paramagnetostriction and the pressure dependence of the susceptibility were measured at low and high temperatures, respectively. It is found that the detailed behavior of the susceptibility cannot be explained within the framework of integer valence (Coqblin–Schrieffer model). The Anderson model, which in addition takes into account charge fluctuations, appears to be more appropriate and indicates that the f-level energy rather than its width is sensitive to the atomic volume change in (formula presented). © 2001 The American Physical Society.},

The evolution of the magnetic susceptibility during disordering of the stoichiometric compound YbInCu4 is described by the model expression taking into account the Tv dispersion upon the application of pressure and variation of composition of YbIn1- xAgxCu4 solid mixtures. The behavior of the main parameters of the system masked by blurring of the magnetic susceptibility singularity for a disordered sample during phase transition. Among other things, the value of the derivative dTv/dx=203 K is determined.

abstract={It is found that the chemical disorder in the compound YbInCu4 , especially in the Yb sublattice, influences significantly its magnetic properties because of the spatial inhomogeneity of the temperature of the first-order valence phase transition. Taking into account the dispersion TV in the model expression for susceptibility, its evolution is described during disordering of the stoichiometric compound YbInCu4 , under applied pressure and in varied compositions of the solid YbIn1-x AgxCu4 solutions. The behavior of the basic parameters of the system masked by the smearing of the magnetic susceptibility feature in a disordered sample during the phase transition has been detected and explained. In particular, the value of the derivative dTV/dx = 203 K is estimated. The sharp change in the concentration dependence of dispersion and the paramagnetic Curie temperature at xc = 0.2 is discussed.},

abstract={The magnetic susceptibility of the intermetallic compounds RInCu4 (R = Gd, Er and Yb) was measured under helium gas pressure up to 2 kbar at the fixed temperatures 78, 150 and 300 K. For YbInCu4, which exhibits a first-order valence phase transition at TV ≃ 40 K, the Grüneisen parameter for the Kondo energy, ΩK ≡ -d ln TK/d ln V = -32, is large and typical for Ce-based heavy-fermion systems in magnitude but opposite in sign. The effect of atomic disorder is discussed on the basis of the data for a chemically disordered sample; the pressure effect at T = 78 K is strongly enhanced due to the spatial dispersion of pressure-sensitive TV, and hence dTV/dP = -2.0 K kbar-1 is obtained by assuming a Gaussian distribution of TV. On the basis of an extrapolation of the experimental pressure dependence, a (P, T) phase diagram is proposed for YbInCu4. Reference compounds with stable f moments, GdInCu4 and ErInCu4, show negligible pressure dependences of the susceptibility. © 1999 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

In order to analyze the experimental magnetovolume effect, to be specific d ln χ/d ln V, the volume dependent electronic structure of UGa3 has been calculated ab initio in the paramagnetic phase by employing a relativistic full-potential LMTO method. The effect of the external magnetic field was included self-consistently by means of the Zeeman operator, as well as orbital polarization. The calculations have brought out a predominance of itinerant uranium 5f states at the Fermi energy, as well as large and competing orbital and spin contributions to χ. The calculated field-induced magnetic moment of UGa3 and its volume derivative compare favorably with our experimental results. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.},

The calculated Fermi surface cross-sections and cyclotron masses are in good agreement with the DHVA experimental data. From the DHVA and heat capacity data together with the results of band structure calculations the average value of the electron-phonon interaction constant lambda equivalent to 0.5 has been deduced for FeGe 2.

abstract={The conduction-electron g factor has been calculated at points on the Fermi surfaces of copper, silver, and gold by a relativistic linearized muffin-tin orbital method in the atomic-sphere approximation. The orbital g factors for principal extremal orbits on the Fermi surface of each metal have been deduced. A comparison with experimental g-factor data makes it possible to estimate the exchange-correlation enhancement factor for electrons on the Fermi surface of copper. The Fermi-surface average of the enhancement factor is in agreement with the predictions of a first-principles calculation, and the data suggest a weak anisotropy. Experimental data for silver and gold prove to be insufficiently accurate to yield reliable values of the exchange-correlation enhancement factor. A g-factor anomaly on the neck orbit in gold is discussed. © 1989 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={Employing the de Haas‐van Alphen effect, the behaviour of small cross‐sections of the Permi surface under pressure has been studied on Mo, W, and Re. The results are discussed in terms of a simple empirical model for spectrum changes under pressure. The model also involves the deformation of d‐band and its shift relative t o the s·p band. The possibility is shown of obtaining quantitative information on the behaviour under pressure of the fundamental parameters of the transition metal energy spectra on the basis of studying small cross‐sections of the Fermi surface.
