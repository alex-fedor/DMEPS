abstract={An experimental solution to the problems of cooling and reliable temperature measurement on samples mounted in vacuum on the cold source in an optical cryostat is advanced and substantiated scientifically. Two typical cases are considered, which differ fundamentally in the sources and heat influxes to the sample, as well as in the mechanical contacts between the sample and cold source. The realistic models of thermal balance developed for the optical elements of the cryostat give rise to numerical estimations consistent with experimental results. Â© 1990.},
