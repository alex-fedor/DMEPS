abstract={An investigation of the mechanisms responsible for the manifestation of the piezoelectric effect in configurations that should not allow for piezoelectric response in the paramagnetic state due to their symmetry. In spite of these symmetry constraints the existence of such a piezoelectric response is detected in this study. It is assumed that these results are associated with the surface on which symmetry constraints are absent. In the magnetically ordered state an indirect piezoelectric effect is both symmetrically permissible and actually observable in these configurations, and it consists of the combined effects of magnetoelectric and magnetoelastic mechanisms.},

abstract={A giant magnetopiezoelectric effect has been revealed in samarium ferroborate. The effective piezomodulus is increased more than twice in the antiferromagnetic phase and it is reduced by a high magnetic field. The nature of the effect is in the joint contribution of both magnetoelectric and magnetoelastic interactions. The evolu-tion of this contribution in the magnetic field is caused by the growth of the magnetic energy including the spin reorientation. Additional data concerning the behavior of the high-frequency magnetocapacitance have been obtained. The parameters of magnetoelectric and magnetoelastic couplings and the magnetic anisotropy constant in the basal plane have been determined. © 2015 American Physical Society.},

The potential and the elastic components of the electron sound demonstrate qualitatively different dependencies on the electron relaxation rate: while the phase of the potential increases with temperature, the phase of elastic displacement decreases. This effect is explained within the multiband model, in which the potential is attributed to the ballistic quasiwave, while the elastic component is associated with the zero-sound wave. We observed a mysterious property of the superconducting state: all manifestations of the potential accompanying the lattice deformations, including usual sound wave, disappear below T c in almost jumplike manner. © 2011 American Physical Society.},

abstract={We present an acoustic method for the study of the effective Magnus force in type-II superconductors. The method is based on the measurement of the amplitude and the phase of the electromagnetic field radiated by a superconductor due to vortex oscillations excited by a transverse elastic wave. The method does not require the flux flow regime and allows us to measure the Magnus force almost everywhere over the range of the existence of the mixed state. We have measured the field dependence of the Magnus force in nonmagnetic borocarbides (electron-type conductors) and in Nb (hole-type conductor). It is found that in borocarbides the sign of the Magnus force in the mixed state has the same sign as the Lorentz force acting on charge carriers in the normal state, and its value (counted per one vortex of unit length) has only a weak dependence on the magnetic field. In Nb the gyroscopic force changes its sign under transition from the normal to the mixed state. The essential point of the method is the registration of the electromagnetic radiation from the superconductor at zero magnetic field caused by the acoustic Stewart-Tolman effect. © EDP Sciences.},

The surface potential is formed by two bulk contributions: the first one is spatially periodic with the period of the sound wave, and the second aperiodic contribution arises due to additional inhomogeneity of the electron distribution near the metal surface. The latter contribution dominates within a nonlocal region of the parameters. The phase shift between these contributions is nearly π/2.

abstract={We develop a new method of investigation of low-temperature electron relaxation \in metals, based on the analysis of the temperature dependences of the attenuation of zero sound excited by ultrasonic pulses. We have discovered that these dependences obtained in the temperature region about of 1-8 K reproduce directly the temperature behavior of the electron scattering rate. The main features of our method are its insensitivity to small-angle scattering and the additivity of contributions of various relaxation processes to the total scattering rate. Both the theoretical analysis of zero-sound propagation in various damping regimes and special experiments produced for gallium confirm the validity of our consideration. We have identified the considerable contribution of electron-electron collisions in all investigated metals (gallium, aluminum, molybdenum, and tungsten) in the whole studied temperature interval and established the dominating role of Umklapp processes in the zero-sound damping at T >- 4 K for gallium and most probably for tungsten. We interpret the latter result as the first experimental observation of Peierls' exponent in polyvalent metals in zero magnetic field. The values obtained for electron-electron and electron-phonon scattering rates are compared with known experimental data and theoretical estimations. © 1993 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

The experimental temperature dependences of the amplitude and the phase velocity of these signals have been studied in the normal and superconducting state. They interpret this effect observed earlier in Ga by Burma et al. as the excitation of a weakly damped zero-sound wave caused by the Fermi-liquid interaction between charge carriers. A dominating role of the electron-electron collisions in the zero-sound damping in Mo was established, and the corresponding relaxation time was estimated. Theoretical calculations of the expected zero-sound behaviour in a superconductor are in good agreement with the experimental data and enable them to determine the intensity of the Fermi-liquid interaction.},
