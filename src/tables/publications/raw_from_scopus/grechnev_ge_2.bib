abstract={The volume dependent electronic structure of the spinel-type lithium manganese oxides (formula presented) (formula presented) is studied ab initio by employing a full-potential electronic structure method. The electronic structure, total energies, open-circuit voltage, and magnetic moments were obtained for various spin configurations of (formula presented) in the cubic spinel structure and the low-temperature orthorhombic structure. The effect of magnetic ordering on the band structure and structural stability has been investigated and an antiferromagnetic ordering proved to be the ground state of the (formula presented) spinels. Our calculations show that the manganese majority (formula presented) band is filled for all (formula presented) compounds studied, and the filling of the minority (formula presented) band is expected in the lithiation process. The lithium intercalation potential, bulk modulus, magnetic moments, and optical properties are calculated within the itinerant band approach and are found to be in good agreement with available experimental data, indicating, that the density-functional theory provides reliable electronic structure of the (formula presented) system. The effect of the orthorhombic distortion on electronic structure and magnetism of (formula presented) was investigated, and our calculations do not show a substantial charge ordering at the structural transition from the cubic spinel to the orthorhombic structure, as proposed earlier. Instead, the low-temperature orthorhombic structure is found to possess the lowest energy via a Jahn-Teller distortion driven by the d band. © 2002 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={First-principles full-potential linear muffin-tin orbital calculations have been used to study (formula presented) in the fluorite (formula presented) and rutile structures. An investigation of the effects of metal and nonmetal alloying, oxygen vacancies, and lattice strain on the phase stabilities and electronic structure has been made. From these theoretical results suggestions on how the cubic phase may be stabilized are made. The pressure induced phase transitions between the rutile, (formula presented) (formula presented) and fluorite phases and the bulk moduli of several (formula presented) and (formula presented) transition metal dioxides have also been studied. © 2002 The American Physical Society.},
