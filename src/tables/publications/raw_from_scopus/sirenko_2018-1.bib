abstract={Neutron diffraction, magnetic and magnetotransport studies of perovskites R1-x 3+Srx 2+ (Mn1-x 3+ Sbx/ 2 5+ )O3 (R = La, Pr) were carried out. It is shown that for x ∼ 0.2 systems undergo a transition from an antiferromagnetic state (x=0) to a ferromagnetic state. In the case of the R=La series a structural transformation from theO?-orthorhombic phase (x=0) to theO-orthorhombic one occurs, which is due to orbital disordering. At x.0.6 cluster spin glass like phases arise due to the competition between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions, as well as due to the strong diamagnetic dilution. In case of the R=Pr series the structural transition into theO-orthorhombic phase was not observed under (Sr, Sb) codoping. As the ionic radius of the rare-earth ion decreases in the series R0.7 Sr0.3 Mn0.85 Sb0.15O3 the crystal structure distortion increases and the ferromagnetic state (R=La, Pr, Nd) is gradually transformed into a spin glass like state (R=Sm, Eu). The ferromagnetic compounds are insulators and exhibit a large magnitude of the magnetoresistance apparently associated with very small amount ofMn4+ ions. The covalent component of the chemical bond and e.g.-orbitals disordering/mixing are assumed to be responsible for ferromagnetism in the compounds under study. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.},
