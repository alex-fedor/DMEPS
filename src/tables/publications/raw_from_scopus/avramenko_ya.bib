abstract={We study the ac electric potential induced by the electron sound wave (a perturbation of the electron distribution function propagating with the Fermi velocity) in single crystals of high-purity gallium. The potential and the elastic components of the electron sound demonstrate qualitatively different dependencies on the electron relaxation rate: while the phase of the potential increases with temperature, the phase of elastic displacement decreases. This effect is explained within the multiband model, in which the potential is attributed to the ballistic quasiwave, while the elastic component is associated with the zero-sound wave. We observed a mysterious property of the superconducting state: all manifestations of the potential accompanying the lattice deformations, including usual sound wave, disappear below T c in almost jumplike manner. © 2011 American Physical Society.},

abstract={We present an acoustic method for the study of the effective Magnus force in type-II superconductors. The method is based on the measurement of the amplitude and the phase of the electromagnetic field radiated by a superconductor due to vortex oscillations excited by a transverse elastic wave. The method does not require the flux flow regime and allows us to measure the Magnus force almost everywhere over the range of the existence of the mixed state. We have measured the field dependence of the Magnus force in nonmagnetic borocarbides (electron-type conductors) and in Nb (hole-type conductor). It is found that in borocarbides the sign of the Magnus force in the mixed state has the same sign as the Lorentz force acting on charge carriers in the normal state, and its value (counted per one vortex of unit length) has only a weak dependence on the magnetic field. In Nb the gyroscopic force changes its sign under transition from the normal to the mixed state. The essential point of the method is the registration of the electromagnetic radiation from the superconductor at zero magnetic field caused by the acoustic Stewart-Tolman effect. © EDP Sciences.},

We propose a model that describes radiation of the EM field from superconductors with nonuniform pinning.
