The features of the temperature and field dependences of the magnetic moment of a single crystal in the temperature range 2-350 K and in magnetic fields up to 5 T along the c axis are studied in detail. It is restored the field de-pendence of the observed temperature points, such as temperature of magnetic ordering, magnetic glass for-mation, magnetic phase separation.

abstract={Analytical and numerical analysis was performed for an electron and phonon spectra evolution under formation of the boundary with "zigzag"-chirality. It is found an ex-citation of the wave with relativistic dispersion. The wave propagates along the boundary and decays with distance from it. The conditions of the occurrence of the wave and its properties are determined. It is shown, in particular, that the wave propagates over the atoms of sublattice, which incorporates those with bonds, broken during for-mation of the boundary. The local densities of states of the atoms of such sublattice gain sharp resonances due to gapped wave. It is found, that a formation on graphene layer of the boundary with given chirality has a similar ef-fect on the phonon modes, which are polarized normally to the layer, and the sharp resonances are formed at fre-quencies in vicinity of quasiflexural ones at quasiwave vector in the K-point of the first Brillouin zone. In this way, appearance of the "zigzag"-boundary increases both the number of charge carriers and of phonons with high group velocity, which are able to produce significant con-tribution to electron-phonon coupling.},

At the same time, the spontaneous magnetization of titanum set exceeds that of manganese set for more than three times, despite that Ti4+ is diamagnetic atom. Residual magnetization of titanum set decreases with increase of temperature, while in manganese set it anomalously grows in the interval 0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.22. Such a behavior of magnetic properties in manganese set is explained by extremally high sensitivity of magnetic anisotropy to variation of crystal spacings, which results in spin reversal.

abstract={ABSTRACT: Measurements of Raman spectra, dielectric constant and magnetization were performed on M-type hexaferrite SrCo2Ti2Fe8O19 single crystal, which was grown by travelling solvent method in an optical furnace. The Raman spectra measurements at room temperature revealed that main Raman modes, which are associated with the bipyramid FeO5, octahedra Fe(4)O6 and Fe(5)O6 as well with mixed octahedral vibration all with A1 g symmetry, shift monotonously to higher wave numbers. In the low-frequency region (&lt;10 kHz), permittivity rapidly decreases with increasing frequency, exhibiting a typical characteristic of Maxwell-Wagner type relaxation. The relaxation peak in dielectric losses centred on 100 kHz can be attributed to ionic relaxation processes caused by multiple valence states of iron ion (Fe2+ and Fe3+). M-type hexaferrite SrCo2Ti2Fe8O19 orders magnetically at 768 K and undergoes order-to-order magnetic phase transition at 380 K. Magnetic properties are almost isotropic around room temperatures with very low hysteresis having coercive field with induction lower than 3×10−3 T and with remnant magnetization lower than 0.17 μB/f.u. for magnetic fields applied along main crystallographic directions. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The temperature dependences of the magnetization in manganites of different composition and structural morphology were measured in two cooling regimes, field cooling (FC) and zero-field cooling (ZFC), for two different orientations of a magnetic field, parallel and perpendicular to the c-axis. The following general tendencies were found: (1) The difference between the magnetizations M<inf>FC</inf> and M<inf>ZFC</inf> at T = 5K increases with increasing magnetic field, reaching the maximum value in a magnetic field of about 2 kOe, and then drops in the range 2-5 kOe; (2) The field dependence of the "splitting" temperature T* below which the difference between the magnetizations M<inf>FC</inf> and M<inf>ZFC</inf> appears can be reasonably well described by a power law with the exponent 2/3 as predicted by the theory of spin glasses. Both results are characteristic for single crystals, as well as for ceramics and films. On the other hand, the field dependence of the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility is different for samples with different degrees of magnetic ordering (Θ/T<inf>C</inf>). These results are consistent with the detected in the present study universality of the line separating the low-temperature region of irreversibility in the H-T phase diagram of manganites. Deviations from the T*-H-line with the exponent 2/3 in strong magnetic fields, which are commonly associated with the appearance of the magnetization component transverse to the magnetic field, are typical for samples containing the antiferromagnetic phase. The interpretation takes into account the multi-phase nature of the systems, i.e., coexistence of spin glass with ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. The observed change in the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility with increasing magnetic field and the behavior of magnetic and thermomagnetic irreversibility are regarded as a manifestation of the spin-reorientation phase transition in an antiferromagnetic environment. This in turn initiates the transformation of the spin-glass-from the Ising- to the Heisenberg-type-which leads to the change in the exponent in the T*-H diagram from 2/3 to 2. The observed phenomenon is universal-it was observed in manganites of different composition and structural morphology-and represents a particular type of polyamorphism, namely, spin-glass polyamorphism. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract={The temperature variation of magnetization is con-sidered for manganites with different composition and structural morphology measured in two cooling re-gimes - in a magnetic field (FC) and without it (ZFC) at two orientations of a magnetic field - along c axis and normal to it. There are found general laws: 1) the difference between MFC and MZFC - magneti-zations at temperature T = 5 K grows with the magne-tic field increase, approaching the maximum value in a magnetic field about 2 kOe, with is followed by de-crease in a range 2-5 kOe; 2) within a magnetic-field range 0-5 kOe, The field dependence of the "splitting" temperature T*, below which the difference of MFC and MZFC magnetizations occurs, is satisfactorily de-scribed by power law with exponent 2/3, which is pre-dicted by the theory of spin glass. Both results are ty-pical as of single crystals, and of ceramics and films as well. At the same time, the field dependences of ani-sotropy of magnetic susceptibility differ for the sam-ples with different level of magnetic ordering (Θ/TC). The results agree with the found in this work univer-sality of the line, which marks the low temperature range of irreversibility at the ?-? phase diagram of manganites. Deviation of the T*-H line with exponent 2/3 in a high magnetic field, which is usually ex-plained by the appearance of a transverse to magnetic field magnetization-component, which is typical of the samples with antiferromagnetic-phase content. Consi-deration takes into account the multiphase state of the system, namely the co-existence of spin glass with fer-ro- and antiferromagnetism. The found change of ani-sotropy of magnetic susceptibility with a magnetic-field increase, peculiarities of the behavior of magnet-ic and thermo-magnetic irreversibility are considered as a manifestation of spin-reorientation phase transi-tion in antiferromagnetic medium. Eventually, it in-duces a spin-glass transformation from Ising-type to Geisenberg one, which results in the change of expo-nent at T*-H diagram from 2/3 to 2. The discovered phenomenon is universal, as it is observed for manga-nites of various composition and structure morpholo-gy, and represents the polyamorphism of some kind - the spin-glass polyamorphism.},

abstract={Peculiarities of the interface interactions of 1-pyrenebutanoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (PSE) with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and enzyme glucoseoxidase (GOX) have been studied with the resonance Raman spectroscopy and theoretical calculations employing the DFT method and the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The interaction of a nanotube with PSE leads to a downshift of the band assigned in the Raman spectrum to the tangential mode of the hybrid with respect to the position of this mode in the spectrum of the pristine SWCNT. The MD simulation demonstrates that the direct interaction between SWCNT and GOX is very strong. This interaction can be expected to change the structure of the enzyme and to significantly affect its activity. The MD simulation also shows that only one PSE molecule used as a linker between SWCNT and GOX is enough to keep GOX near the nanotube surface in the water surrounding and to prevent strong interaction between SWCNT and GOX. However, to stabilize this nanobiohybrid in water at least two PSE linkers are needed. The molecular structure of PSE is determined using the density functional theory approach (DFT/B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p). The geometries and the relative stabilities of all possible PSE conformers are characterized in the calculations. High structural flexibility of the PSE molecule is demonstrated. Calculations (at the M05-2X level of theory) have also been performed on the structures and the interaction energies of complexes formed by various SWCNTs with PSE and pyrene. Pyrene interacts strongly with the surface of carbon nanotubes with different chiralities, but the interaction with zigzag nanotubes is stronger than with armchair ones of the same diameter. Increasing the diameter of the SWCNTs leads to a higher adsorption energy, reaching the maximum value for graphene (-20.8 kcal/mol). © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={The generation of defects in NbSe2 single crystals by electron irradiation has been investigated by a combination of ac susceptibility and structural measurements. Remarkably, thanks to the layered structure of NbSe2, we show that electronic irradiation cannot only create point defects but also in-plane extended defects, which modify anisotropically the ac response. Indeed, the analysis of the onset of the nonlinear susceptibility response, Hacl(T), as a function of irradiation dose and field orientation shows a correlated increase in the density of anisotropic defects induced by electron irradiation. Also, we measured a decrease in the strength of the pinning (Labusch) constant αL accounting for elastic vortex oscillations within the linear Campbell regime for high-dose-irradiated samples in a transverse field, again compatible with the presence of planar defects hindering vortex pinning. X-ray powder diffraction and TEM electron diffraction measurements suggest these in-plane defects may result from the rupture of Se-Se bonds and the formation of nanorods and nanowires by NbSe2 sheet rolling. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The phonon spectra of niobium diselenide nanofilms, consisting of several structural elements of this compound, as well as graphite nanofilms starting with bigraphene are analyzed at the microscopic level. The partial contributions of the displacements of atoms along the strong and weak coupling directions (i.e. along and perpendicular to the layers) to the phonon density of states are calculated. The characteristic distinguishing features of the vibrational spectral of these structures are analyzed. The fact that our calculations are practically identical to the data obtained from neutron diffraction, acoustic, and optical experiments confirms that the description of the phonon spectra of the compounds is highly accurate. The temperature dependences of the mean-square shifts for bulk samples and nanofilms along different crystallographic directions, making it possible to evaluate the stability of the graphite and niobium diselenide nanofilms at low temperatures, are calculated for each compound studied. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={Albeit rather simple structure and ample experimental study of charge density wave (CDW) superconductor 2H-NbSe2 its behaviour in a CDW regime (TCDW 32.5 K, TSN 7.2 K) remains unclear. The relevance of the known mechanisms of CDW formation to this hexagonal modification of the niobium diselenide is not straightforward. Occurrence of the lock-in transition in this compound is still debated despite numerous structural investigations by means of diverse diffraction techniques. Here, we present Debye patterns measured in a detail at temperatures 8-35 K with different sources of X-ray irradiation and energy resolution of about 1eV.

abstract={A direct evidence of X-ray scattering by electron modulation in a charge-density wave metal dominating over the periodic lattice distortion (PLD) is presented for hexagonal modification of niobium diselenide (2H-NbSe 2). Namely, new pronounced features appear in X-ray diffraction below TCDW indexed in the space group D3h 1 with a doubled in-plane parameter a and the inversion symmetry axis instead of screw one. Above TCDW transition, the space group D6h 4 with lattice parameters a0=3.44, c=12.8 is revealed in agreement with published data. The observed difference is due in particular to different mechanisms of neutron and X-rays scattering by spatial distribution of nuclei or electron density, respectively. A CDW formation in 2H-NbSe 2 is then accompanied by spatial modulation of electron density with periodicity 2a, manifested in X-ray scattering with a nuclei shift insufficient for neutron scattering. Indeed, numerous studies show enigmatic absence of Fermi-surface nesting in 2H-NbSe2 and, eventually, long coherence length. Within McMillan's consideration it means that in this case, electron modulation should dominate the distortion of periodic crystal potential rather than commonly observed periodic lattice distortion, e.g. in TaSe2. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The layered charge-density wave (CDW) superconductor 2H-NbSe2 (TS=7.2 K) is the very first material in which quantum oscillations have been observed in the mixed state by means of magnetization and magnetostriction measurements. The magnetostriction technique offers the advantage that quantum oscillations are particularly pronounced, which is due to pressure sensitivity of the relevant cross-section of the Fermi surface. Moreover, measurements can be performed for a field oriented along the crystallographic axis in contrast to the torque technique that is routinely used. Here we present magnetostriction measurement on a high-quality single-crystalline sample for temperatures 0.25-8.0 K using a sensitive capacitance dilatometer. Two oscillation frequencies are observed at the lowest temperatures for the in-plane orientation of the applied magnetic field. These new data reveal that the Fermi-surface sheet in the first Brillouin zone has two cross-sections, rather than the conventional pan-cake shape. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={93Nb NMR studies were carried out for a single crystal of NbSe2 at 73.328MHz in the temperature range 9-300K to investigate the normal and charge density wave (CDW) states. Detailed analysis of the NMR line shape of the central transition using a classical incommensurate model reveals the change in the conduction electron spin dynamics from above TCDW. An increase of the Knight shift below TCDW reflects modification to the uniform part of the conduction electron density of states. As suggested theoretically, the Knight shift distribution is found to be directly proportional to the square of the amplitude of the CDW. The results further indicate an incommensurate CDW state in 2H-NbSe2. Analysis of the NMR spectra using the McMillan incommensurate model suggests a large value of the discommensuration parameter (γ) which is almost temperature independent, in contrast to the much smaller value previously reported in the case of 2H-TaSe2. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

With these results the validity of the Second Ehrenfest relation for this type II superconductor was checked. The temperature dependences of the heat capacity and the thermal expansion along the crystallographic axis s{cyrillic} were measured. Both properties manifest the sharp features of BCS-type at the superconducting transition and more diffuse features at the CDW transitions. These results, together with the First Ehrenfest relation, allowed us to estimate the critical temperature derivative on uniaxial pressure applied along the hexagonal axis s{cyrillic}, pIIs{cyrillic}, (∂ TSN / ∂ p/ / c)P → 0 = + 1.45 ± 0.05 K / GPa.

Sixty two phonon modes (of the total 69 Raman-active phonon modes allowed for the monoclinic C6 2h structure) are identified in the spectra, and their behavior is analyzed. Several distinct features are observed in Raman spectra at low temperatures: (i) three low-frequency bands (22.3, 29.4, and 49.0 cm-1 at T = 15 K) with a temperature behavior characteristic of the one-magnon scattering and (ii) a band at 56.3 cm-1 with a pronounced temperature dependence. The origin ofthe low-temperature bands is discussed. © 2009.},

abstract={Phosphorescence spectra of crystalline ortho-bromobenzophenone (2-bromobenzophenone, 2BrBP) were measured from 1.6 K to room temperature. A cardinal emission mechanism crossover occurs within this temperature range. At low temperature the phosphorescence spectrum is a superposition of two similar sets of equidistant bands spaced by the CO stretch frequency. We ascribe these two sets to the emission of two different conformers, one of which is metastable and does not manifest itself above approximately 70 K. The presence of two conformers is explained by the fact that the 2BrBP molecule deforms considerably upon excitation. The emission from the stable conformer survives up to approximately 140 K or even higher. At roughly 60 K and higher, another type of emission reveals itself in the shape of two very broad, partly overlapping bands, which gains in intensity with increasing temperature. Above 150 K only this two-hump feature is observed in phosphorescence spectra. Additional phosphorescence experiments were carried out to elucidate the nature of this spectrum, including phosphorescence measurements of 2BrBP in ethanol solutions as well as time-resolved and varying-excitation-intensity measurements from crystals. Based on results of all the experiments reported here and on our own single-crystal x-ray structure data we conclude that the above two-band spectrum recorded near room temperature is due to the emission of single-photon bimolecular triplet excimer formed by the carbonyl groups of two neighboring 2-bromobenzophenone molecules. This is the first time that a bimolecular excimer has been observed and reliably identified in a benzophenone derivative solid. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={It is shown that long-lived photoinduced dichroism in garnets is caused by photoproduced charges with anisotropic structure, which retains a memory of the pumping light polarization for a long time, while photoinduced absorption is due to all photoproduced charges irrespective of their intrinsic structure.

It has been shown that complex magnetic behavior of the samples observed at low temperatures can be adequately described using a magnetic phase separation model. In the framework of this model, the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phases have different sign of the f-d exchange. The neodymium magnetic moments start to be ordered near the Neel temperature (Curie temperature). They are directed parallel to the moments of the manganese ions in the ferromagnetic phase, and opposite to this direction in the antiferromagnetic phase. The first-order magnetic phase transition associated with reorientation of the magnetic moments of the ferromagnetic phase along the Nd magnetic moments in the antiferromagnetic phase is observed for the samples from an intermediate range of hole concentration near T eff∼ 9 K. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={In the garnet NaCa2Mn2V3O12, a sharp dependence of photoinduced absorption, ΔK, on the pumping light polarization was observed: the ratio between the maximum and minimum values of ΔK exceeds 10. This ratio, characterizing optical dichroism, is much less (1.1-1.2) for the garnets Ca3Mn2Ge3O 12 and Ca3Ga1.99Mn0.01Ge 3O12 where the dichroism, created by a polarized pumping light, relaxes slower after switching off irradiation. Hence, the degree of dichroism is mainly determined on the stage of its creation. Based on this and other experimental facts, a microscopic mechanism of dichroism is proposed and grounded; it involves a two-site anisotropic structure of holes photoproduced in the oxygen sublattice of a garnet.},

abstract={A study of crystal structure, elastic, and magnetic properties of low-doped Nd1-xCaxMnO3 (x ≤ 0.15) perovskites has been carried out. The ferromagnetic component is shown to increase under hole doping and, simultaneously, the temperature of the orbital order-disorder phase transition decreases. The mechanism of the concentrational transition from a weak ferromagnetic state (x = 0) to a ferromagnetic one (x &gt; 0.15) is discussed using a two-phase model, according to which the samples consist of weak ferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phases exchange coupled at their boundary. It is found that interaction between different magnetic phases leads to spin reorientation which takes place for 0.06 ≤ x ≤ 0.1 compounds around Teff ∼ 9 K. In the temperature range from 5 to 20 K, metamagnetic behaviour is revealed for the Nd0.92Ca 0.08MnO2.98 sample. H versus T as well as T versus x magnetic phase diagrams, which are characterized by the missing of a canted phase, are proposed. The appearance of orientational transitions is explained on the basis of a magnetic analogue of the Jahn-Teller effect taking into account that the magnetic moments of Nd ions are ordered parallel to the moments of Mn ions in the ferromagnetic phase, and opposite to the direction of the weak ferromagnetic vector at T &gt; Teff in the weak ferromagnetic phase.},

A comparison of the dependence observed in experiment with that calculated with allowance for the fractional contribution of surface atoms shows that for clusters with N̄≥4×103atoms/cluster the increase of 〈u2〉1/2 with decreasing N̄ is due solely to the growth of the relative number of surface atoms. The correlation between the calculation and experiment vanishes when N̄≤4×10 3atoms/cluster. In that case the experimental values are considerably higher than the calculated value, a circumstance which indicates that in small aggregations there are other factors besides the surface which contribute to the growth of 〈u2〉1/2. © 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) produced by the high pressure CO disproportionation (HiPCO method) and purified by controlled thermal oxidation in air have been studied by Raman spectroscopy at 300 and 5 K. Raman spectra have been observed at λexc=632.8 and 441.6 nm laser excitation in the range of 160-1800 cm-1. In the low-frequency part of the spectra (the radial breathing mode range) eleven narrow lines can be detected at low temperatures, enabling an estimation of nanotube diameters (0.8-1.3 nm) and chirality. The width at half-maximum intensity of these spectral lines is about 3-4 cm-1 at 5 K. The Stokes and anti-Stokes spectra are measured at λexc=632.8 nm at room temperature. The most intense lines in these spectra are caused with the resonant Raman-scattering process. With increasing temperature from 5 to 300 K the shift (3-4 cm-1) of the most intense high-frequency component of the tangential mode (G mode) to lower frequency is observed. Based on the analysis of the Stokes/anti-Stokes spectra and the G band shape, the corresponding lines were identified with metallic or semiconducting type of nanotubes. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Unusual features of the kinetics of photoinduced phenomena are indicative of the underlying electronic processes. The comparison with the case of Ca3Mn2Ge3O12, explored earlier by the authors, permits one to finally establish the main common mechanisms of photoinduced absorption and dichroism caused by random electric fields of photoproduced charges (hole polarons). The rate of their diffusion and relaxation through recombination is strongly influenced by the same fields, whose large statistical straggling is responsible for a broad continuous set of relaxation components (observed in the relaxation time range from 1 to about 1000 min). For Ca3Ga2-xMnxGe3O12, the time and temperature dependences of photoinduced absorption and dichroism bear a strong imprint of structure imperfection increasing with x.},

It is shown that the electrons in chains with self-localization form a phase with local magnetic ordering and relaxation time greater than 10-7s. Analysis of the magnitude of the accompanying charge redistribution suggests that when an electron undergoes self-localization a pair of exchange-coupled electrons localized predominantly on the oxygen is formed. Such a quasiparticle, consisting of a pair of antiferromagnetically oriented atomic moments and a pair of self-localized electrons, possesses integral spin and can form a Bose condensate.© 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={The static magnetization MN and dynamic magnetic susceptibility χac of polycrystalline manganite La0.66Ba 0.34MnO3 are investigated in the temperature region 5K&lt;T&lt;350K. Measurements are made on a sample with a demagnetizing factor N=5.4 in static magnetic fields H in the range 0-120 Oe and on a toroidal sample with N=0 in fields with frequencies of 120 and 1000 Hz and amplitudes from 8×10-3 to 4.1 Oe. The effect of a uniaxial pressure P=0.1kbar on the static susceptibility χN=MN/H is investigated in the region 5K&lt;T&lt;270K. It is found that in the magnetically ordered state (below 314 K) χac is independent of the field amplitude in the interval 1.5-4.1 Oe and independent of temperature between 250 and 302 K. At a temperature Tp=250K a second-order phase transition (discontinuity of the derivative ∂χac/∂T) is observed, and at T i=177.5K - a first-order phase transition (discontinuity of χac(T)). The uniaxial pressure leads to an anomalous lowering of the susceptibility in the region 160-250 K with a sharp minimum at 200 K. The temperature and field dependence of the magnetic susceptibility outside the phase transition region are interpreted in terms of ideas about the formation of a helicoidal magnetic structure in the system in low fields at a temperature below 302 K. © 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={Static magnetization MN and dynamic magnetic susceptibility χac of polycrystalline manganite La0.66Ba0.34MnO3 are studied in a temperature range 5 K &lt; T &lt; 350 K. The measurements are carried out on a sample with demagnetization factor N = 5.4 in static magnetic field H between 0 and 120 Oe, and on a toroidal sample with N = 0 in fields of a frequency of 120 and 1000 Hz and of an amplitude of 8.10-3-4.1 Oe, respectively. The effect of uniaxial pressure P = 0.1 kbar on static susceptibility χN = MN/H is studied in a region 5 K &lt; T &lt; 270 K. It is found that in the magnetically ordered state (below 314 K) the χac value does not depend on magnetic field amplitude in an interval 1.5-4.1 Oe and on temperature between 250 and 302 K. At the temperature Tp = 250 K a second order phase transition was found (a break in the ∂χac/∂T derivative), while at the Ti =177.5 K it was a first order one (a break in the χac(T) dependence). The uniaxial pressure results in an abnormal decrease of the susceptibility in the range 160-250 K with an acute mimimum at 200 K. The temperature and field dependences of the magnetic susceptibility outside the phase transitions region were interpreted using the concepts of the formation of a helical magnetic structure in the system in weak fields below the 302 K.},

Analysis of the accompanying charge redistribution suggests that the electron self-localization creates a pair of exchange interacted electrons which are mainly localized in oxygen sites. Such a quasiparticle, which consists of a pair of antiferromagnetically oriented atomic moments and a pair of self-localized electrons, has an integer spin and may form a Bose-condensate.},

The visible light induces the phase transition in the (Pr,La,Ca)MnO3 manganites from an insulating antiferromagnetic (AFM) state to a metallic ferromagnetic (FM) one. In the AFM garnet Ca3Mn2Ge3O12, the illumination with linearly polarized visible light changes the field of metamagnetic (MM) phase transition induced by a magnetic field. The mechanisms responsible for the photoinduced phenomena in mixed-valence manganese oxides are discussed.

abstract={Measurements of photoinduced light absorption in Ca3Mn 2Ge3O12 revealed some unusual features: a saturation with the pumping intensity and a broad straggling of relaxation times with a predominance of very long times. These experimental facts cannot be understood in terms of photoinduced absorption centers associated with impurities or lattice defects, but are naturally explained within the notion of random electric fields of active charges. Active charges are produced by light pumping via the dissociation of coupled pairs of charges (consisting of a Mn-hole coupled with a compensating negative impurity or a negatively charged vacancy) which exist in the ground state. Such active charges create electric fields in a larger volume than coupled pairs, thus enhancing the probability for forbidden optical transitions. On the other hand, the random fields of active charges promote hopping of holes and hence the relaxation of photoinduced effects. A broad distribution of random-field magnitudes gives rise to a very broad range of hole hopping rates. There is also a much faster annihilation process immediately conditioned by light pumping. The simultaneous action of these relaxation channels, depending on the number of active charges, pumping intensity, and temperature, explains the entire experimental picture qualitatively and in part quantitatively. Photoinduced dichroism as well as birefringence, observed under polarized pumping, are caused by an anisotropic distribution of photoproduced holes over polarization directions. © 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={A doublet structure of the electron-two magnon absorption hand with maxima at 2.145 and 2.28 eV is observed for the first time in a metal phase of YBa2Cu3O6+x with x = 0.85 (Tc = 88 K). On cooling of the YBCO film the doublet band appears abruptly in the region of the formation of pseudogap state at T &lt; 130 K and is conserved in the superconducting phase at T &lt; Tc. There occurs an additional increase in the, amplitudes of each of the doublet components under the superconducting transition. The comparison with the data on neutron scattering peak splitting in YBCO (P. Dai et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 80, 1738 (1998)) suggests that the splitted absorption band is accounted for by the formation of a stripe superstructure which is an alternation of dielectric and metal quasi-one-dimensional stripes.},

The mechanical stress derivative of the extremal cross-sectional area of the Fermi surface is derived from a thermodynamic analysis. The values obtained are considerably higher, by an order of magnitude, than those for other metals, which explains the observed enhancement of the magnetostriction oscillations in comparison with the magnetization oscillations. © 2001, American Institute of Physics.

abstract={Measurements of photoinduced light absorption in Ca3Mn2Ge3O12 revealed some unusual features: a saturation with the pumping intensity and a broad straggling of relaxation times with a predominance of very long times. These experimental facts cannot be understood in terms of photoinduced absorption centers associated with impurities or lattice defects, but are naturally explained within the notion of random electric fields of active charges. Active charges are produced by light pumping via the dissociation of coupled pairs of charges (consisting of a Mn-hole coupled with a compensating negative impurity or a negatively charged vacancy) which exist in the ground state. Such active charges create electric fields in a larger volume than coupled pairs, thus enhancing the probability for forbidden optical transitions. On the other hand, the random fields of active charges promote hopping of holes and hence the relaxation of photoinduced effects. A broad distribution of the magnitudes of random fields gives rise to a very broad range of the hole hopping rates. There is also a much faster annihilation process immediately conditioned by light pumping. The simultaneous action of these relaxation channels, depending on the number of active charges, pumping intensity and temperature, explains the entire experimental picture qualitatively and in part quantitatively. Photoinduced dichroism as well as birefringence, observed under polarized pumping, are caused by an anisotropic distribution of photoproduced holes over polarization directions.},

abstract={The properties of Na0,6Ca0,4(Mn1-xMe)O3 (Me = Cr3+, Al3+, Ti4+, Nb5+) are studied. These substitutions are found to destroy the long-range order in distribution of Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions, but the properties depend significantly on the type of substitution. A minor substitution of Mn3+ with Cr3+ (0.04 ≤ x ≤ 0.1) results in antiferromagnet - ferromagnct and insulator - metal transitions. At the Cr content x ≥ 0.1 the solid solutions become insulating and exhibit the properties of inhomogeneous ferrimagnets, where the magnetic moments of Cr and Mn ions are opposite. At T &lt; 30 K a phase transition occurs causing the magnetic moments of Nd3+ ions to arrange antiparallelly to the moments of Mn ions. All Cr-containing samples exhibit a significant magnetoresistance effect at temperatures below the Curie point. The substitution of manganese by Al3+, Ti4+, or Nb5+ ions leads to the transition from the antiferromagnetic state to a spin-glass one with no change of resistivity. The data obtained are indicative of the antiferromagnetic character of superexchange interactions between Cr and Mn ions.},

abstract={The absorption spectra of single-crystal YBa2Cu3O6+x films with various doping levels from x ≈ 0.35 to x ≈ 0.9 have been measured in the energy range of 0.3-3 eV. The absorption spectral composition is analyzed in terms of intraband and interband transitions as well as local Cu2+ dd-transitions. It is concluded that the dxy → dx2-y2 transition at 1.5 eV reflects the strengthening of cuvalent bonding (pd-hybridixation) in the process of metallization while the spectral peak at ≈ 1.8 eV provides information about the contribution of electron correlations, since they are sensitive to the opening of the spin gap in the insulator and to antiferromagnetic fluctuations in the metal. The covalent (1.5 eV) and correlation (≈ 1.8 eV) absorption peaks have been found to compete during metallization. However the coexistence of these bands allows one to speak about the validity of the correlation polaron model according to which there exists covalent Cu-O bonding within the polaron moving in the environment of the Hubbard antiferromagnetic fluctuations.},

It is shown that the indicated substitutions destroy the long-range order in the positions of the Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions, but the properties depend sharply on the type of substituent ion. The replacement of a small fraction of the Mn3+ ions by Cr3+ (0.04≤x≤0.1) leads to antiferromagnet-ferromagnet and insulator-metal transitions. At chromium concentrations x≥0.1 the solid solutions again become nonconducting and exhibit the properties of inhomogeneous ferrimagnets in which the magnetic moments of the chromium and manganese ions are directed opposite to each other. For T≤30 K there is a phase transition in which the magnetic moments of the Nd3+ ions order antiparallel to the moments of the Mn ions. All of the samples containing chromium have a large magnetoresistive effect at temperatures below the Curie point. The replacement of manganese by Al3+ , Ti4+, or Nb5+ ions leads to a transition from the antiferromagnetic state to a spin glass state with no change in conductivity. The data obtained indicate that the superexchange interactions between the chromium and manganese ions is of an antiferromagnetic character. ©2000 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={The absorption and luminescence excitation spectra of the quasi-one-dimensional antiferromagnet CsMnCl3·2H2O (CMC) doped with copper ions (0-3%) are studied in the temperature range 4.2-80 K. Impurity absorption is detected in crystals: it is weak in the infrared (11 000 cm-1) and strong in the ultraviolet (20 000-33 000 cm-1) ranges. The possibility of excitation exchange between the high-energy states of the impurity and matrix is discussed. Computer simulation of the exciton migration in a doped CMC crystal is performed, taking into account the impurity-matrix transitions of excitations in the high-energy states. The conclusion is derived that the energy transfer by an electron excitation from Mn2+ to Cu2+ occurs only in the lowest excited state (due to migration of excitons and their trapping by the Cu2+ ions).},

abstract={Photoillumination causes an augmentation of optical absorption within the band corresponding to a forbidden transition. The observed kinetics of photoinduced absorption displays a broad continuous distribution of absorption centers over relaxation times, which cannot be explained, with allowance for the temperature dependence of the relaxation kinetics, in terms of absorption centers associated with impurities or lattice defects. The experimental picture, including its temperature changes, is described by the model of active charges (hole polarons) which arise under light pumping and produce random electric fields. These fields play a double role: they partly eliminate the forbiddenness of the optical transition, thus enhancing its oscillator strength, and significantly shorten the lifetime of active charges. A broad continuous distribution of random fields over magnitudes entails the corresponding lifetime distribution of active charges covering several orders of magnitude. © 2000 The American Physical Society.},

Crystal data: T = 164 K; a = 24.527 (6), b = 6.064 (1), c = 7.457 (4) Å; β = 100.10 (2)°; V = 1091.9 (6) Å3; Z = 4; dc = 1.528 g cm-3; λ(Mo Kα) = 0.71073 Å; μ = 0.565 mm-1 ; F(000) = 512; R = 0.04. The temperature dependence of the unit-cell parameters and of the intensities of some symmetry-sensitive reflections has been measured over the range 164-293 K, both in warm-up and cool-down experiments. It has been established that the phase transformation between the C2/c and I2/c structures occurs as a sequence of two closely spaced first-order phase transitions. In between these phase transitions the crystal is in an intermediate state whose structure is different from both C2/c and I2/c. The experimental data give us ground to suppose that the intermediate state is disordered, having a primitive cell half as large as in the two ordered phases. Within the temperature interval where the said intermediate state exists the thermal expansivity along axis c is negative.},

abstract={The paper is concerned with phenomena of different nature associated with a long-distance potential relief, created in the conductive plane by negative ions of dopant oxygen. The long-distance potential gives rise to a secondary electronic structure responsible for the phenomena under consideration. The association between low-temperature resistivity and secondary structure was confirmed by experiments. Increase in the residual resistivity with decreasing temperature and Its high sensitivity to a photo-illumination affecting the long-distance potential suggest a low-temperature localization of holes in the long-distance potential wells. Optical transitions between the levels of the secondary structure have been considered, too. Such transitions differ from usual optical transitions by a higher probability and sensitivity to the shape of the long-distance potential well. The results obtained agree well with the literature data on optical absorption spectra.},

Quenching of the exciton luminescence in these crystals is due to exciton trapping. A model of triplet excitons migrating along the one-dimensional (1D) chain with traps and 100 cm-1 energy barriers has been suggested. The barriers are formed in crystals by the triplet state of the Nd8-TCPA molecules. In this temperature range the main mechanism of exciton passing the barriers is tunneling. The temperature dependence of exciton rate of barrier passing (W) has been obtained. Effects of the barrier shape and width on W(T) have been considered. This experimental dependence was fitted to the calculative curves and satisfactory agreement has been achieved if one assumed that low-frequency phonons (25 cm-1) participated in exciton tunneling. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={The paper is concerned with phenomena of different nature associated with a long-distance potential relief, created in the conductive plane by negative ions of dopant oxygen. The long-distance potential gives rise to a secondary electronic structure responsible for the phenomena under consideration. The association between low-temperature resistivity and secondary structure was confirmed by experiments. Increase in the residual resistivity with decreasing temperature and its high sensitivity to a photo-illumination affecting the long-distance potential suggest a low-temperature localization of holes in the long-distance potential wells. Optical transitions between the levels of the secondary structure have been considered, too. Such transitions differ from usual optical transitions by a higher probability and sensitivity to the shape of the long-distance potential well. The results obtained agree well with the literature data on optical absorption spectra.},

abstract={Dopant impurity ions affect the motion of the hole carriers not only by means of providing the holes in the conductive plane but also by creating an aperiodic potential relief consisting of wide potential wells. Photoillumination of the sample, redistributing impurity ions over the CuOx chain plane, varies both the number of hole carriers n (n-process) and the potential relief (s-process). In the present work these processes were separated in the course of the photoillumination by using a large difference in their characteristic times. As a result, it was found that the s-process essentially affects the critical temperature of superconductivity. A mechanism is proposed which realizes the connection of superconductivity with the potential relief and naturally explains the observed regularities.},

It was shown that the nonevident selection rule for the observation of the two-particle peak-shape band originated mainly from magnons near the one-dimensional Brillouin zone boundary due to the specific zig-zag-type disposition of the Mn2+ ions in the chain structure.},

abstract={The emission decay kinetics and relative quantum yields of exciton luminescence of (Formula presented)-doped (3%) quasi-one-dimensional antiferromagnetic crystals (Formula presented)⋅(Formula presented)O have been studied in the temperature range from 4.2 to 77 K. The experimental emission decay curves have been approximated by the calculated curves obtained using computer simulation of incoherent excitons motion. The model assumes a slow interchain hopping process and a rapid intrachain migration of excitons. Exciton hopping (W) and trapping (U) rates at 4.2-77 K have been defined. A decrease of both U and W rates has been observed with a temperature lowering. The proposed model of exciton migration and trapping considered excitation passing potential barriers between (Formula presented)-(Formula presented) and (Formula presented)-(Formula presented) ions. To describe the deviation of U(T) and W(T) dependences from the Arrhenius law we suppose that excitons pass barriers by both hopping over it and tunneling. The energies and shapes of the barriers have been estimated. The tunneling processes were taken into account while determining the barriers energy. The role of both the exciton-phonon interaction in (Formula presented)⋅(Formula presented)O and the spin forbiddeness of the low-temperature (T≤30 K) exciton migration along a chain due to the antiferromagnetic spin ordering has been discussed. © 1996 The American Physical Society.},

It is shown that at a critical value of the magnetic field Hc≈ 1.8 T oriented along the “easy” b-axis in antiferromagnet CsMnCl3.2H20 a first-order orientational phase transition (spin-flop transition) occurs. As a result of the spin-flop transition the antiferromagnetism vector l is oriented along the “intermediate” c-axis. The maximum field deflection angle Ψc from the b-axis in the bc-plane at which the first-order phase transition disappears is determined. The magnetic Hamiltonian parameters obtained are responsible for the energy of the “interionic” (5.04.10-2T) and “intraionic” (1.05. 10-1T) magnetic anisotropy. The antiferromagnetism vector l direction is determined in antiferromagnet MnF2in the spin-flop phase (l||[100]) for an exact field orientation along the “easy” Cl4-axis. Magnetic anisotropy parameters in the basal plane are estimated: of fourth order (HA4≈ 3 • 10-3T) and of second order (Hd&lt; 10-1T).

Two-magnon scattering is shown to be attenuated upon Ar+ laser irradiation. The effect is observed both in superconducting and nonsuperconducting samples and dependent on the oxygen concentration. Low temperature measurements made it possible to find correlation between the photoinduced decrease of the two-magnon scattering intensity and an increse of electrical conductivity. © 1991.},

abstract={Antiferromagnetic crystals in which crystallographic sites occupied by magnetic ions from various sublattices are not transnationally equivalent and are not associated with each other by a symmetry center can have magneto-optic properties distinct from the properties of other antiferromagnets. In particular, birefringence and dichroism of linear polarized light can be observed which are directly proportional to the magnetic field strength, as well as magnetic rotation and circular dichroism quadratic in the field strength. Both effect-the linear magneto-optic effect and quadratic magnetic gyration - are sensitive to the crystal magnetic symmetry and to reorientation of the antiferromagnetic vector. Both effects reverse their signs when the directions of the magnetic moments of a sublattice are changed. These properties of new magneto-optic effects can be used to study the time-reversed domain structure of antiferromagnets, to define the symmetry of magnetic ordering and to study the magnetic crystal energy spectra by spectroscopic methods. The results of experimental studies of the linear magneto-optic effect and quadratic magnetic rotation in tetragonal antiferromagnetic fluorides of transition metals, manganese-germanium garnet and other antiferromagnets are reported. Experimental results on the domain structure of high symmetric antiferromagnets, the point magnetic symmetry of non-collinear multisublattice antiferromagnetic garnet MnGeG are discussed. © 1987.},

abstract={The paper summarizes, analyzes and generalizes the results of theoretical and experimental studies in optical spectroscopy (light absorption and luminescence) of antiferromagnetic dielectric crystals. Optical excitations of the unfilled 3d shells of magnetic ions are described as small-radius Frenkel excitons in terms of both phenomenological and microscopic approaches. the latter is preferable as it is suitable to develop a consistent exciton theory of optical magnetic excitations where one-particle optical excitation parameters are related to those of many-particle exciton-magnon excitation, both being reduced to three independent parameters determined experimentally from the antiferromagnetic resonance and pure exciton light absorption data. The same approach accounts for the peculiarities of antiferromagnet luminescence due to the exciton motion character (coherent or incoherent), exciton localization in antiferromagnets with low-dimensional magnetic structure and exciton delocalization by an applied magnetic field. The situation is less straightforward as regards nonlinear optical processes for which many experimental data are available (two-exciton light absorption at four-quantum excitation, statistical properties of the effect of light on four-photon absorption). The paper explains them only qualitatively, since there is no complete theory. Optical spectroscopy of antiferromagnets has reached the stage permitting its purely magnetic applications: spectroscopic study of spin waves energy, both at the centre and at the boundary of the Brillouin zone; spectroscopic study of equilibrium magnetic structures and orientational magnetic phase transitions, especially those induced by high external magnetic field; spectroscopic study of photoinduced effects, viz., photoinduced magnetic anisotropy and photoinduced magnetic phase transitions. © 1986.},

The appearing birefringence is connected with inducing the nonequivalency of magnetic sublattices by a magnetic field. The sign of the linear magnetooptical effect depends on the directions of the sublattice magnetic moments and the magnetic field strength. It is determined by sign of the antiferromagnetic vector projection on some axis only if the magnetic field direction is constant. This circumstance gives a possiblity of visualizing the regions of the crystals having oppositely oriented antiferromagnetic vectors. The visual observation of the 180-degree antiferromagnetic domains in the two-sublattice antiferromagnetic cobalt fluorite by means the new linear magnetooptical effect is reported.},

abstract={The magnetic dipolar line splitting of the pure exciton6A1g→4Eg(4G) transition has been investigated experimentally in a wide range of magnetic fields (reaching 300 kOe) and with the application of uniaxial stress along the basic crystallographic directions. In the general case the observed splitting is produced by two mechanisms. The reorientation of the sublattice magnetic moments brings about a removal of the twofold orbital degeneracy of the4Eg(4G) state. The violation of the moments' strict collinearity results in the Davydov splitting. A magnetoelastic mechanism of the degeneracy lift has been given a detailed consideration. On the basis of the spectroscopic data numerical estimates are obtained of the magnetoelastic constants. The alteration of the exchange field HE for the U2+ transition to the excited state4Eg(4G) has been evaluated from the "mass-center" shift of the Davydov doublets that takes place in high magnetic fields. The intensities and polarizations are calculated in the Heitler-London approximation of the exciton transition Davydov components. The orbital portions of the wave functions of the involved states are simple cubic harmonics. The Davydov split zones have been identified and the sign determined of the intersublattice resonant interaction energy. © 1973 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

abstract={A complex study of magnetization change, optical Faraday effect, and light absorption spectrum has been carried out on uniaxial antiferromagnetic crystals of MnF<inf>2</inf>of FeCO<inf>3</inf>under the phase transitions induced by strong external magnetic field. The measurements were made at 4.2 and 20.4 K, which is lower than Néel temperature (T<inf>n</inf>=68 and 38 K for MnF<inf>2</inf>and FeCO<inf>3</inf>, respectively). The field used was pulsed up to 400 kOe. MnF<inf>2</inf>: The magnetic properties have been studied in detail employing a pickup coil method in a narrow range of magnetic fields near the spin-flopping field (H<inf>c</inf>=92 kOe) with a strict field orientation along the tetragonal axis of the crystal symmetry. The angular field deviation Ψ from the c<inf>4</inf>axis is controlled to within 1.5'. In the narrow range of angles Ψ < 30', the differential magnetic susceptibility near the spin-flopping field H<inf>c</inf>depends on the sample form and the magnetization process is of a jump-like character. The measurements of the longitudinal (along the magnetic field) and transversal susceptibility components made using three pickup coils of mutually perpendicular axes and three coaxial coils shifted along the sample axis show that at Ψ < 30' and H=H<inf>c</inf>± 200 Oe the sample magnetically cleaves into interchanging layers of 10-5cm<inf>3</inf>volume which stretch along the symmetry axis of the sample and differ from each other by a longitudinal component of the magnetization vector.

abstract={Experimental and theoretical investigations have been made on the antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR) in the monoclinic crystal CoWO4 (TN = 55°K). Observations were made with polarized radiation in the frequency range 7 to 250 cm-1, at temperatures of 5·3-60°K. The experimental data indicate that the ground state in CoWO4 in fields under 18 kOe is antiferromagnetic. The magnetic properties of the crystal proved to be symmetric with respect to three orthogonal twofold axes x, y and z. The 'magnetic' axes x and z are inclined to the vectors a and c of the crystal unit cell at an angle of 40° in the ac-plane. The magnetic axis y lies along the crystal (true) twofold axis b. The principal axes of the dielectric ellipsoid are different from the 'magnetic' axes, except for the y(b)-axis. This fact must be taken into account when investigating the AFMR lines (intensity and polarization). Anomalous temperature dependences of the resonance frequencies and of the integrated absorption have been found. The experimental results on the position of the resonance frequencies and their dependence on the magnetic field, and on the shapes, polarization, and intensities of the AFMR lines are discussed within the framework of the phenomenological model of two sublattices and a fictious spin s = 1/2. This allows a comprehensive analysis of the possible states in the 2z+, 2x- structures, including the Dzyaloshinsky interaction and the high anisotropy in the g-factor values. Special cases are considered in which the external d.c. magnetic field is applied along each of the 'magnetic' axes. Fitting the model to the data results in the following model parameters: (A = 3 {dot operator} 85.108 Oe2 ; U = 0 {dot operator} 45.108 Oe2 ; b1 = 0 {dot operator} 15.108 Oe2 ;; b2 = 0 {dot operator} 35.108 Oe2 ; gx x = 3 {dot operator} 15 ; gv v = 4 {dot operator} 8 ; gz z = 6{dot operator}3). The data on the susceptibilities could be included in the analysis only in the paramegnetic range of temperatures (70-150°K), where the higher Kramer's doublets are not yet populated and the ordering effects can be neglected. © 1972.},

abstract={The magnetostriction of antiferromagnetic Cr2O3 has been measured in a magnetic field directed along the crystal symmetry axis. In the field Hc = 60 kOe which corresponds to a spin‐flip transition we have observed jumps in the crystal sizes. The deformation along the symmetry axis is 2.8 × 10−5 and the relative volume change is 2.0 × 10−5. The form of the magnetostriction curves may be accounted for by the dependence of magnetic anisotropy energy on the interatomic distances. The calculation of magnetic dipole interaction in the given crystal provides jump values which are considerably lower than those observed. The contributions to the magnetic anisotropy energy arising from considering the spin‐orbit coupling are assumed to be important for magnetoelastic properties of Cr2O3.

abstract={The optical “double” transition spectrum of crystalline oxygen is studied in the frequency range of 15000 to 31000 cm−1 at different temperatures (5 to 27 °K) and nitrogen concentrations (0 to 40%). A sharp integral intensity decrease of the absorption bands, their shift, and broadening are found in the temperature range investigated. With the insertion of nitrogen into oxygen new absorption bands with spectral positions close to the pure oxygen band frequencies appeared in the oxygen spectrum. The results show that the “double” transitions in oxygen are considerably induced by exchange interaction. It is also shown that the O−0 band intensity of the 23 Σ g− → 21Δg and 23Σ g− → 21 Σ g+ transition is determined by the interaction not with acoustic phonons, as it was considered before, but with magnons corresponding to the Brillouin zone boundary and having an energy equal to the exchange one gμBHE. The O−0 band of the 23Σ g− → 1Δg + 1Σ g+ transition is interpreted as a pure electronic band. A consistent scheme, based on considering the exchange splitting of the 3Σ g− ground state of the oxygen molecules and the magnon excitation at light absorption is suggested to explain the “double” transition structures and their band behaviours at magnetic ordering.

abstract={An experimental study is made of the effect of high magnetic fields on the structure of the optical absorption spectra of Mn2+ and Co2+. The study uses single crystals of antiferromagnetic fluorides and carbonates of the ions and also single crystals of fluorides of mixed content, containing both ions simultaneously. The investigations are carried out at 20.4 and 4.2 °K, which is significantly lower than the temperature of antiferromagnetic ordering (TN). Magnetic fields of up to 1.7 · 105 Oe are used. The magneto‐optical effects found in the fluorides are connected with spin‐flipping of the magnetic sublattices by the external field. This may be due to a significant spin‐orbital exchange in states (the final states for the optical transitions responsible for the absorption bands) which respond to the re‐establishment of the antiferromagnetic structure by the external field. Zeeman splitting and shift of some absorption lines is observed in antiferromagnetic carbonates in which the magnetic structure cannot be changed by the external field. This is accounted for on the basis that the internal field HE, perpendicular to the C3‐axis of the crystal, effects some excited states of Mn2+ and Co2+ significantly less than the external field H parallel to C3‐axis although H ≪ HE.
