abstract={The influence of the external magnetic field on the Jahn-Teller phase transition at Tc ≈ 14 K is studied in the single crystal KDy(MoO4)2. At temperatures below Tc the essential change of the velocity and attenuation of acoustic modes of the crystal is discovered in the magnetic field, oriented along the [110] direction. Such a behavior of elastic characteristics is determined by the destruction of the antiferrodistorsive ordering, connected, in turn, with the ordering of the quadrupole orbital moments, charecteristic for the "orbital nematic". The low temperature part of the H-T phase diagram for this direction of the field is restored. It is disco-vered that the critical temperature dependence on the field is nonmonotonic, i.e., the phase transition has the re-entrant character. Theoretical description of the observed anomalies of the temperature and magnetic field behavior of the acoustic characteristics is given.},

abstract={Sputtering yields have been measured for unstrained Si1-xGex (x=0-1) alloys when bombarded with Ar+ ions within the linear cascade regime. Nonlinear S-shape dependence of the sputter yield as a function of the alloy composition has been revealed. The dependence is analyzed within the frameworks of the cascade theory conventionally accepted to be the most systematic to date theoretical approach in sputtering. In view of a linear composition dependence predicted for the sputter yield by the cascade theory adapted for polyatomic substrates, the nonlinearity observed in our experiments is shown to be related to the alloying effect on the surface binding energies of the alloy components. Based on this analysis, an interpretation is proposed for the experimentally observed nonlinear composition dependence of Si1-xGex sputter yield. The yield is expressed by an equation derived from the cascade theory with additional terms of the composition parameter x. The form of the equation implies that for a polyatomic substrate the surface binding energy of an individual atom is determined not only by its own chemical identity but to a considerable degree by the identities of its neighbors. © 2005 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={Implantation of 240 keV Pb + ions into a Ni (110) single crystal to a fluence of 10 16cm -2 at room temperature and 470 K, respectively, resulted in the formation of a metastable supersaturated Pb-Ni solid solution with a maximum lead concentration of 2.4 at.%. Rutherford backscattering/channeling analysis and transmission electron microscopy have shown that in the as-implanted state most of the Pb atoms were distributed on substitutional lattice sites in the host matrix while a small fraction of Pb was confined within nanoscale precipitates. Most of the precipitates, with sizes ranging from 2 to 15 nm, were single crystalline although bi-, tri-, and tetracrystals were occasionally observed. Upon heating, decomposition of the metastable alloy was observed, with strong outdiffusion of a large fraction of Pb to the surface. By means of angular scan channeling analysis, the lattice location of the implanted Pb atoms was followed directly during in situ isochronal annealing at different temperatures up to 860 K. Thermally activated formation of Pb atom-vacancy complexes was found to cause originally substitutional Pb atoms to change to different types of lattice site occupation. The regular and distorted substitutional, octahedral interstitial, and random locations of the Pb atoms appeared to be strongly correlated with the temperature of the annealing. © 2002 American Institute of Physics.},
