abstract={Analytical and numerical analysis was performed for an electron and phonon spectra evolution under formation of the boundary with "zigzag"-chirality. It is found an ex-citation of the wave with relativistic dispersion. The wave propagates along the boundary and decays with distance from it. The conditions of the occurrence of the wave and its properties are determined. It is shown, in particular, that the wave propagates over the atoms of sublattice, which incorporates those with bonds, broken during for-mation of the boundary. The local densities of states of the atoms of such sublattice gain sharp resonances due to gapped wave. It is found, that a formation on graphene layer of the boundary with given chirality has a similar ef-fect on the phonon modes, which are polarized normally to the layer, and the sharp resonances are formed at fre-quencies in vicinity of quasiflexural ones at quasiwave vector in the K-point of the first Brillouin zone. In this way, appearance of the "zigzag"-boundary increases both the number of charge carriers and of phonons with high group velocity, which are able to produce significant con-tribution to electron-phonon coupling.},

abstract={A negative linear thermal expansion observed experimentally in a number of crystalline compounds with a complicated lattice and anisotropic interaction between atoms. The nature of negative linear thermal expansion along a number of directions is explained on the basis of calculations which were carried out at a microscopic level. We analyze anomalies in the temperature dependence of the coefficients of linear thermal expansion (the LTEC) along different directions: in layered crystals, formed as a monoatomic layers (graphite and carbon nanofilms) and multilayer "sandwiches" (dichalcogenides of transition metals); in multilayer crystal structures such as high-temperature superconductors in which the anisotropy of the interatomic interaction is not saved in the long-range order; in carbon nanotubes. The results of theoretical calculations are compared with the data of x-ray, neutron diffraction and dilatometric measurements. © Alexey Kavokin, Timothy C.H.
