abstract={A theoretical and experimental study of the electron structure and nature of the chemical bonds in FeTe compounds in antiferromagnetic (AFM) and paramagnetic phases. It is established that the nature of the chemical bonds is mainly metallic, and the presence of covalent bonds Fe-Te and Te-Te helps to stabilize the structural distortions of the tetragonal phase of FeTe in the low-temperature region. It is found that the bicollinear AFM structure corresponds to the ground state of the FeTe compound and the calculated value of the magnetic moment MFe = -2.4μB is in good agreement with the data from neutron diffraction measurements. At the same time, the Fermi surface (FS) of the low-temperature AFM phase is radically different from the FS of the paramagnetic FeTe. Reconstructing the FS can lead to a sign change of the Hall coefficient observed in FeTe. The calculation results serve as evidence of the fact that the electron structures and magnetic properties of FeTe are well-described by the model of itinerant d-electrons and the density functional theory (DFT-GGA). © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract={The magnetic properties of Fe1+yTe single crystals (y≃ 0.10.18) were studied at temperatures 4.2300K. At an ambient pressure, with decreasing temperature a drastic drop in χ(T) was confirmed at T≃ 6065K, which appears to be closely related to the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering. It is found that the magnitudes of the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility Δχ in the AFM phase are close in the studied samples, whereas the sign of the anisotropy apparently depends on the small variations of the excess iron y in Fe1+yTe samples. The performed DFT calculations of the electronic structure and magnetic properties for the stoichiometric FeTe compound indicate the presence of frustrated AFM ground states. There are very close energies and magnetic moments for the double stripe configurations, with the AFM axes oriented either on the basal plane or along the [0 0 1] direction. Presumably, both these configurations can be realized in Fe1+yTe single crystals, depending on the variations of the excess iron. This can provide different signs of magnetic anisotropy in the AFM phase, presently observed in the Fe1+yTe samples. For these types of AFM configuration, the calculations for the FeTe values of Δχ are consistent with our experimental data. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The electronic energy structures and magnetic properties of layered superconductors RNi2B2C, RFe4Al8, and FeSe are systematically studied, by using the density functional theory (DFT). The calculations allowed us to reveal a number of features of the electronic structure, which can cause the manifestation of peculiar structural, magnetic and superconducting properties of these systems. It is demonstrated that the Fermi energy EF is located close to the pronounced peaks of the electronic density of states (DOS). The main contribution to DOS at the Fermi level arises from 3d-electrons. The calculations of the pressure-dependent electronic structure and the magnetic susceptibility in the normal state indicate that the novel superconductors are very close to a magnetic instability with dominating spin paramagnetism. It is shown that experimental data on the pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature in FeSe correlate qualitatively with the calculated behavior of DOS at EF as a function of the pressure. © G.E.

A sharp suppression of amplitude for the first harmonic of the dHvA oscillations is observed for a number of orbits on the Fermi surface of FeGe2. It is found that the conditions of the dHvA amplitude sup-pression ("spin-splitting zero") are changed for FeGe2 doped with cobalt. To analyse the experimental data we proposed a method of comprehensive calculation of conduction electron g-factors in itinerant antiferro-magnetic systems, which is based on the calculations of spin-polarized electronic structure, taking into ac-count the spin-orbit interaction, and estimated the fac-tor of exchange enhancement of spin paramagnetism in FeGe2.},
