abstract={An x-ray analysis of MgB2-based materials shows that they contain MgB2 and MgO phases. According to a quantitative Auger analysis (taken after removing the oxidized surface layer by Ar ion etching in the microscope chamber) the MgB2 phase contains some amount of oxygen that approximately corresponds to the composition MgB2.2-1.7O0.4-0.6. Rietveld refinement of the MgB2 phase, based on EDX data with varying B/O content, leads to the composition MgB1.68-1.8O0.2-0.32. Ab-initio modelling of boron substitution by oxygen in MgB2 (ΔH f = -150.6 meV/atom) shows that this is energetically favourable up to the composition MgB1.75O0.25 (ΔH f = -191.4 meV/atom). In contrast to carbon substitution, where very small levels of doping can dramatically affect the superconducting characteristics of the material with concomitant changes in the electron density, oxygen substitution results in very little change in the superconducting properties of MgB2. The formation of vacancies at the Mg site of both MgB2 and substituted MgB1.75O0.25 was modelled as well, but has shown that such processes are energetically disadvantageous (ΔHf of Mg0.875B2 and Mg0.75B1.75O0.25 are equal to -45.5 and -93.5 meV/atom, respectively). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={This paper describes the established correlations between the characteristics of MgB2-based superconducting materials and their structural features, in particular the oxygen distribution and content. As indicated by SEM and Auger analysis, a sizeable amount of oxygen is usually present in superconducting MgB2 -based materials (bulks, thin films, and wires). The matrix phase of bulk MgB2 contains rather small amounts of oxygen, but contains a high amount of dispersed inclusions or areas with compositions close to MgBO. X-ray phase analysis with Rietveld refinement (using the FullProf Suite program package) of several highly dense MgB2 -based bulk samples (with high critical current densities) showed that the superconducting phase had a composition within the range MgB1.68O0.26 and MgB1.74O0.32 instead of pure MgB2. Besides, a small amount of a phase with MgO structure was observed in the materials by X-rays as well. The calculation of the enthalpy of formation confirms the possibility of oxygen solubility in MgB2 and shows that the formation of MgB1.75B0.25 is most favorable. The results of ab initio calculations of the electronic structure and stability of the MgB2 compounds with partial oxygen substitution for boron show that it is energetically preferable for oxygen atoms to replace boron pairwise. © 2002-2011 IEEE.},

The experimental results are supplemented by theoretical calculations of the volume dependent electronic structure of SmS and orbital magnetism of the band electronic states χVV(band). It was found that χVV(band) value appeared to be strongly dependent on pressure, determining the main mechanism of the observed puzzling pressure effects in semiconducting SmS compound. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The comparison of nano-crystalline MgB2 oxygen-containing thin film (140 nm) and highly dense bulk materials showed that the critical current density, Jc, depends on the distribution of Mg-B-O nano-scale inhomogeneities. It has been shown that MgB2 bulks with high Jc in low (∼106 A/cm2 in 0-1 T at 10 K) and medium magnetic fields contain MgB0.6-0.8O0.8-0.9 nano-inclusions, where δTc or a combined δTc (dominant) / δl pinning mechanism prevails, while in bulk MgB2 with high Jc in high magnetic fields (Birr(18.5 K) = 15 T, Bc2(0 K) = 42.1 T) MgB1.2-2.7O1.8-2.5 nano-layers are present and δl pinning prevails. The structure of oxygen-containing films with high Jc in low and high magnetic fields (Jc (0 Т) = 1.8 × 107 А/сm2 and Jc (5 Т) = 2 × 106 А/сm2 at 10 К) contains very fine oxygen-enriched Mg-B-O inhomogeneities and δl pinning is realized. The results of DOS calculations in MgB2-xOx cells for x = 0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1 demonstrate that all compounds are conductors with metal-like behaviour. In the case of ordered oxygen substitution for boron the binding energy, Eb, does not increase sufficiently as compared with that for MgB2, while when oxygen atoms form zigzag chains the calculated Eb is even lower (Eb = −1.15712 Ry). © 2016},

abstract={The relevant pinning centers of Abrikosov vortices in MgB2-based materials are oxygen-enriched Mg-B-O inclusions or nanolayers and inclusions of MgBx (x&gt;4) phases. The high critical current densities, j c, of 106 and 103A/cm2 at 1 and 8.5 T, respectively, at 20 K can be achieved in polycrystalline materials (prepared at 2 GPa) containing a large amount of admixed oxygen. Besides, oxygen can be incorporated into the MgB2 structure in small amounts (MgB1.5O0.5), which is supported by Auger studies and calculations of the DOS and the binding energy. The j c of melt textured YBa2Cu3O7-δ (or Y123)-based superconductors (MT-YBaCuO) depends not only on the perfectness of texture and the amount of oxygen in the Y123 structure, but also on the density of twins and micro-cracks formed during the oxygenation (due to shrinking of the c-lattice parameter). The density of twins and microcracks increases with the reduction of the distance between Y2BaCuO5 (Y211) inclusions in Y123. At 77 K jc=8•104 A/cm2 in self-field and jc=103 A/cm2 at 10 T were found in materials oxygenated at 16 MPa for 3 days with a density of twins of 2235 per μm (thickness of the lamellae: 45-30 nm) and a density of micro-cracks of 200280 per mm. Pinning can occur at the points of intersection between the Y123 twin planes and the Y211 inclusions. MTYBaCuO at 77 K can trap 1.4 T (38×38×17 mm, oxygenated at 0.1 MPa for 20 days) and 0.8 T (16 mm in diameter and 10 mm thick with 0.45 mm holes oxygenated at 10 MPa for 53 h). The sensitivity of MgB2 to magnetic field variations (flux jumps) complicates estimates of the trapped field. At 20 K 1.8 T was found for a block of 30 mm in diameter and a thickness of 7.5 mm and 1.5 T (if the magnetic field was increased at a rate of 0.1 T) for a ring with dimensions 24×18 mm and a thickness of 8 mm. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={A theoretical and experimental study of the electron structure and nature of the chemical bonds in FeTe compounds in antiferromagnetic (AFM) and paramagnetic phases. It is established that the nature of the chemical bonds is mainly metallic, and the presence of covalent bonds Fe-Te and Te-Te helps to stabilize the structural distortions of the tetragonal phase of FeTe in the low-temperature region. It is found that the bicollinear AFM structure corresponds to the ground state of the FeTe compound and the calculated value of the magnetic moment MFe = -2.4μB is in good agreement with the data from neutron diffraction measurements. At the same time, the Fermi surface (FS) of the low-temperature AFM phase is radically different from the FS of the paramagnetic FeTe. Reconstructing the FS can lead to a sign change of the Hall coefficient observed in FeTe. The calculation results serve as evidence of the fact that the electron structures and magnetic properties of FeTe are well-described by the model of itinerant d-electrons and the density functional theory (DFT-GGA). © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract={The electronic structure and chemical bonds character of FeTe compound in antiferromagnetic (AFM) and paramagnetic phases were studied both experimentally and theoretically. Predominantly, metal character of chemical bonds in FeTe compound is established, and the presence of covalent bonds between Fe-Te and Te-Te atoms provides stabilization of structural distortions of the tetragonal phase at low temperatures. It is established that double stripe AFM phase corresponds to the ground state of FeTe compound, and the calculated value of magnetic moment MFe = 2,4μB is in agreement with the results of neutron diffraction measurements. At the same time, the Fermi surface (FS) of low-temperature AFM phase substantially differs from FS of paramagnetic FeTe. Fermi surfase reconstruction at AFM transition can produce a sign change of the Hall coefficient which was observed in FeTe. Results of the calculations demonstrate that electronic structure and magnetic properties of FeTe are well described within the itinerant d-electrons approach and the density functional theory (DFT-GGA).},

abstract={The magnetic properties of Fe1+yTe single crystals (y≃ 0.10.18) were studied at temperatures 4.2300K. At an ambient pressure, with decreasing temperature a drastic drop in χ(T) was confirmed at T≃ 6065K, which appears to be closely related to the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering. It is found that the magnitudes of the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility Δχ in the AFM phase are close in the studied samples, whereas the sign of the anisotropy apparently depends on the small variations of the excess iron y in Fe1+yTe samples. The performed DFT calculations of the electronic structure and magnetic properties for the stoichiometric FeTe compound indicate the presence of frustrated AFM ground states. There are very close energies and magnetic moments for the double stripe configurations, with the AFM axes oriented either on the basal plane or along the [0 0 1] direction. Presumably, both these configurations can be realized in Fe1+yTe single crystals, depending on the variations of the excess iron. This can provide different signs of magnetic anisotropy in the AFM phase, presently observed in the Fe1+yTe samples. For these types of AFM configuration, the calculations for the FeTe values of Δχ are consistent with our experimental data. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The electronic energy structures and magnetic properties of layered superconductors RNi2B2C, RFe4Al8, and FeSe are systematically studied, by using the density functional theory (DFT). The calculations allowed us to reveal a number of features of the electronic structure, which can cause the manifestation of peculiar structural, magnetic and superconducting properties of these systems. It is demonstrated that the Fermi energy EF is located close to the pronounced peaks of the electronic density of states (DOS). The main contribution to DOS at the Fermi level arises from 3d-electrons. The calculations of the pressure-dependent electronic structure and the magnetic susceptibility in the normal state indicate that the novel superconductors are very close to a magnetic instability with dominating spin paramagnetism. It is shown that experimental data on the pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature in FeSe correlate qualitatively with the calculated behavior of DOS at EF as a function of the pressure. © G.E.

This dependence is compared with first principles calculations of the electron structure and magnetism of FeSe, FeTe, and FeSe<inf>0.5</inf>Te<inf>0.5</inf> as functions of pressure, as well as with our earlier experimental data on the effect of pressure on the magnetic susceptibility of the normal state in FeSe and FeTe. This comparison is indicative of a competitive interrelationship between superconductivity and magnetism in tellurium rich FeSe<inf>1-x</inf>Te<inf>x</inf> compounds. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract={The magnetic properties of nitrogen-doped multi-walled carbon nanotubes (N-MWCNTs) were studied in the temperature and magnetic field range of (4.2-290) K and (0.05-30) kOe, respectively. Also magnetic properties of the reference MWCNTs without nitrogen doping were investigated on the same footing for comparison. The presence of iron-based particles inside N-MWCNTs was detected. The low temperature SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) magnetization measurements were supplemented with thermogravimetric analysis. The magnetic characterization provided the saturation magnetic moment M S and residual magnetization MR of N-MWCNTs to be, respectively, 4.5 emu/g and 0.9 emu/g, whereas for the reference MWCNTs the corresponding parameters are found to be about twice higher. The coercive field value amounts to 800 Oe for both systems at low temperatures, then decreasing to about 450 Oe at 200 K. Copyright © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

abstract={A detailed magnetization study for the novel FeSe superconductor is carried out to investigate the behavior of the intrinsic magnetic susceptibility χ in the normal state with temperature and under hydrostatic pressure. The temperature dependences of χ and its anisotropy Δχ = χ- χ are measured for FeSe single crystals in the temperature range 4.2-300 K, and a substantial growth of susceptibility with temperature is revealed. The observed anisotropy Δχ is very large and comparable to the averaged susceptibility at low temperatures. For a polycrystalline sample of FeSe, the significant pressure effect on χ is determined to be essentially dependent on temperature. Ab initio calculations of the pressure-dependent electronic structure and magnetic susceptibility indicate that FeSe is close to magnetic instability, with dominating enhanced spin paramagnetism. The calculated paramagnetic susceptibility exhibits a strong dependence on the unit cell volume and especially on the height Z of chalcogen species from the Fe plane. The change of Z under pressure determines a large positive pressure effect on χ, which is observed at low temperatures. It is shown that the literature experimental data on the strong and nonmonotonic pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature in FeSe correlate qualitatively with the calculated behavior of the density of electronic states at the Fermi level. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The dc paramagnetic susceptibility of Gd was measured in the temperature range 295-365 K and under hydrostatic pressure up to 0.16 GPa, yielding values of the paramagnetic Curie temperature Θ and its pressure derivative. Based on the results of ab initio electronic structure calculations, the experimental behavior of Θ under hydrostatic pressure together with the literature data on the uniform and uniaxial pressure effects was examined within a mean-field like approach. For this purpose, the effective d-band susceptibility and the relevant exchange integrals were calculated as functions of the lattice parameters within the density functional theory. These calculations provided a reasonable description of the experimentally observed uniform pressure effect, but a less satisfactory description of the uniaxial pressure effect. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The magnetic susceptibility χ of FeTex compounds () was studied under hydrostatic pressure up to 2kbar at fixed temperatures of 55, 78 and 300K. Measurements were taken both for polycrystalline and single crystalline samples. At ambient pressure, with decreasing temperature a drastic drop in χ(T) was confirmed at K, which appears to be closely related to antiferromagnetic ordering. The obtained results have revealed a puzzling growth of susceptibility under pressure, and this effect is enhanced by lowering the temperature. To shed light on the pressure effects in the magnetic properties of FeTe, abinitio calculations of its volume dependent band structure and the exchange enhanced paramagnetic susceptibility were performed within the local spin density approximation. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={A paramagnetic response of transition metals and itinerant d - and f -metal compounds in an external magnetic field is studied by employing ab initio full-potential LMTO method in the framework of the local spin density approximation. Within this method the anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility in hexagonal close-packed transition metals is evaluated for the first time. This anisotropy is owing to the orbital Van Vleck-like paramagnetic susceptibility, which is revealed to be substantial in transition-metal systems due to hybridization effects in the electronic structure. It is demonstrated that compounds TiCo, Ni3 Al, Y Co2, Ce Co2, Y Ni5, La Ni5, and Ce Ni5 are strong paramagnets close to the quantum critical point. For these systems the Stoner approximation underestimates the spin susceptibility, whereas the calculated field-induced spin moments provide a good description of the large paramagnetic susceptibilities and magnetovolume effects. It is revealed that an itinerant description of hybridized f electrons produces magnetic properties of the compounds Ce Co2, Ce Ni5, U Al3, U Ga 3, U Si3, and U Ge3 in close agreement with experiment. In the uranium compounds U X3 the strong spin-orbit coupling together with hybridization effects give rise to peculiar magnetic states in which the field-induced spin moments are antiparallel to the external field, and the magnetic response is dominated by the orbital contribution. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={B12-cluster compounds have attracted considerable interest in recent years. This is above all due to the unique combination of their physical properties, such as high melting point, hardness, thermal and chemical stability, and rich magnetic properties. Among them, the rare earth dodecaborides (REB12), which crystallize in the NaCl based fcc structure, exhibit a variety of physical properties which result mainly from strong electron correlations of the 4f shell of rare earth ions. Thus e.g., LuB12 with a fully occupied 4f shell is a metal which becomes superconducting below 0.4 K, YbB12 is a Kondo insulator, and TmB12, ErB12, HoB12, DyB12 and TbB12 are metals which order antiferromagnetically in the Kelvin temperature range. In our review we present results of recent investigations performed on these materials. Attention is devoted above all to superconducting and magnetic properties of dodecaborides, however, also their structural, thermal and transport properties, as well as lattice and magnetic excitation spectra are presented and discussed. Results of first principles electronic structure calculations are shown too. © 2008 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Ab initio band structure calculations are carried out for the higher borides MB6and MB12. High-precision measurements of the elastic constants are performed for the compounds ZrB12, HoB 12, ErB12, TmB12, LuB12, YB 6 and LaB6 at low temperatures. The bulk properties of the borides are analyzed on the basis of the calculated equations of states and balanced crystal orbital overlap populations. Our calculations indicate that hexaborides with divalent metals, CaB6, SrB6, BaB 6, and YbB6, are semiconductors with small energy gaps. The metallic MB6 hexaborides with trivalent M atoms are found to possess larger bulk moduli values. For dodecaborides the bulk moduli are found to be higher for MB12 with increased filling of the conduction band (ZrB12, HfB12, UB12) in comparison with M 3+B12 compounds. The total energy calculations for different magnetic configurations in YbB12 point to the possibility of antiferromagnetic coupling between Yb3+ ions. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={Ab initio band structure calculations have been carried out for higher borides MB6 and MB12. High precision measurements of the elastic constants were performed for ZrB12, HoB12, ErB12, TmB12, LuB12, YB6 and LaB6 compounds at low temperatures. The bulk properties of the borides have been analyzed on the basis of the calculated equations of states and balanced crystal orbital overlap populations. Our calculations indicate that hexaborides with divalent metals, CaB6, SrB6, BaB 6, and YbB6, are semiconductors with small energy gaps. The metallic MB6 hexaborides with trivalent M atoms are found to possess larger bulk moduli values. For dodecaborides bulk moduli are found to be higher for MB12 with increased filling of the conduction band (ZrB12, HfB12, UB12), comparatively to M 3+B12 compounds. The total energy calculations for different magnetic configurations in YbB12 point to a possibility of antiferromagnetic coupling between Yb ions.},

Three dimensional (3D) electron-positron (e-p) momentum densities ρ(p) are reconstructed from two dimensional (2D) angular correlation of annihilation radiation (ACAR) spectra measured for paramagnetic ErGa3. Reconstructed densities in the extended p-space, folded into the reduced k-space, are compared with the theoretical results.

This study includes the promising materials for spin electronics with reported high temperature ferromagnetism, namely, doped divalent hexaborides CaB6, SrB 6, BaB6, and the CaB2C2 compound, as well as Kondo semiconductors, SmB6 and YbB12. For CaBe and SrB6 a semiconducting band structure has been obtained, whereas a semimetallic ground state is revealed for CaB2C2 and doped hexaborides. For YB6, LaB6, CaB2C 2 and the semimetallic Ba1-xLaxB6 alloys we have performed spin-polarized band structure calculations in an external field to evaluate the induced spin and orbital magnetic moments. These calculations indicate a feasibility of the field-induced weak ferromagnetic phase in ~CaB2C2 and the La doped hexaborides. The LSDA and GGA calculations for different spin configurations of YbB12 point to a possibility of antiferromagnetic coupling between Yb3+ ions.

The anisotropy of the absorption spectra is due to the difference in the optical matrix elements for two different polarizations, which is a result of the anisotropic crystallographic and electronic properties of LiC6. Theory and experiment agree well for the π* and σ* resonances. By comparing calculations which include the effect of the core hole with similar calculations which do not, we conclude that 1s x-ray absorption in LiC 6 is partly associated with an excitonic effect. The electronic structure and optical absorption spectrum of LiMn2O4 spinel has been calculated and compared with available experimental data. The calculated absorption coefficient appeared to be in agreement with experiment, and the features of the absorption are associated with transitions between the exchange and crystal-field split t2g and eg d-bands of manganese in LiMn2O4 spinel.},

abstract={The seismic anisotropy of the Earth's core is believed to be due to a preferred orientation of hexagonal close packed (hcp) iron crystals that constitute the dominating element in the inner core. In this connection, the magnetic properties of the hcp iron in an external magnetic field are very interesting and are studied here by employing an ab initio full-potential linear muffin tin orbital method. By this means the magnetic susceptibility Χ of hcp iron and its anisotropy energy for pressures and temperatures corresponding to the Earth's inner core conditions have been evaluated in the framework of the local spin density approximation. The accuracy of this method has been validated by calculating the anisotropic susceptibility of paramagnetic transition metals that form in the hcp crystal structure at ambient conditions. Our calculations demonstrate that for hcp iron the anisotropy of Χ is dependent on the c/a ratio. In conjunction with recent data on the c/a ratio and elastic constants of hcp iron, the magnetic anisotropy can explain the seismic anisotropy of the Earth's inner core.},

The electronic structure, total energies, open-circuit voltage, and magnetic moments were obtained for various spin configurations of LixdMn2O4 in the cubic spinel structure and the low-temperature orthorhombic structure. The effect of magnetic ordering on the band structure and structural stability has been investigated and an antiferromagnetic ordering proved to be the ground state of the LixMn2O4 spinels. Our calculations show that the manganese majority t2g d band is filled for all LixMn2O4 compounds studied, and the filling of the minority t2g band is expected in the lithiation process. The lithium intercalation potential, bulk modulus, magnetic moments, and optical properties are calculated within the itinerant band approach and are found to be in good agreement with available experimental data, indicating, that the density-functional theory provides reliable electronic structure of the LixMn2O4 system. The effect of the orthorhombic distortion on electronic structure and magnetism of LiMn2O4 was investigated, and our calculations do not show a substantial charge ordering at the structural transition from the cubic spinel to the orthorhombic structure, as proposed earlier. Instead, the low-temperature orthorhombic structure is found to possess the lowest energy via a Jahn-Teller distortion driven by the d band.},

abstract={The magnetic susceptibility χ of the itinerant antiferromagnetic compound UGa3 has been studied experimentally under pressure up to 2 kbar in the temperature range 64-300 K. This study reveals a pronounced pressure effect on magnetic properties of UGa3 and the measured pressure derivative of the Néel temperature is found to be dTN/dP=-1.1 K/kbar. In order to analyze the experimental magnetovolume effect, to be specific d ln χ/d ln V, the volume dependent electronic structure of UGa3 has been calculated ab initio in the paramagnetic phase by employing a relativistic full-potential LMTO method. The effect of the external magnetic field was included self-consistently by means of the Zeeman operator, as well as orbital polarization. The calculations have brought out a predominance of itinerant uranium 5f states at the Fermi energy, as well as large and competing orbital and spin contributions to χ. The calculated field-induced magnetic moment of UGa3 and its volume derivative compare favorably with our experimental results. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.},

The obtained magnetovolume effect values dln chi /dlnV and results of detailed theoretical calculations of density of states at the Fermi level as a function of the lattice constant were used to evaluate volume derivatives of the electron-electron interaction parameter J: dlnJ/dlnV=-0.9+or-0.15 (Ni3Al) and -0.95+or-0.15 (TiCo). These results are compared with theoretical estimates of dlnJ/dlnV from ab initio LMTO band structure calculations.},

abstract={The pressure effect on the magnetic susceptibility of FeSi has been studied in the temperature range 78-300 K. Assuming the leading role of the gap value Eg as the energy parameter in this range the value dln Eg/dln V = -6 was evaluated. The electronic structure of FeSi was determined using the local spin-density functional approximation and the LMTO method to solve the band structure problem self-consistently. The obtained fine structure of the density of states near the gap differs from the DOS curve for MnSi. The stability of monosilicides is discussed by considering the bonding origin of electronic states near the Fermi energy. The calculated derivative dln Eg/dln V = -5.9 is in agreement with the experimental one. © 1994.},

abstract={The electronic and magnetic structure of tetragonal FeGe2 is determined using the local spin-density functional approximation and the ASW method to solve the band-structure problem self-consistently. The calculations reveal that the collinear antiferromagnetic structure-in contrast to a non-collinear one-has the lowest total energy and seems the most preferable candidate for the low-temperature ground-state phase of FeGe2 in agreement with recent neutron diffraction experiments. The calculated Fermi surface cross-sections and cyclotron masses are in good agreement with the DHVA experimental data. From the DHVA and heat capacity data together with the results of band structure calculations the average value of the electron-phonon interaction constant lambda equivalent to 0.5 has been deduced for FeGe 2. For the alternative non-collinear model the authors obtained a higher value of the total energy and poor agreement with the DHVA experiment.},

abstract={The conduction-electron g factor has been calculated at points on the Fermi surfaces of copper, silver, and gold by a relativistic linearized muffin-tin orbital method in the atomic-sphere approximation. The orbital g factors for principal extremal orbits on the Fermi surface of each metal have been deduced. A comparison with experimental g-factor data makes it possible to estimate the exchange-correlation enhancement factor for electrons on the Fermi surface of copper. The Fermi-surface average of the enhancement factor is in agreement with the predictions of a first-principles calculation, and the data suggest a weak anisotropy. Experimental data for silver and gold prove to be insufficiently accurate to yield reliable values of the exchange-correlation enhancement factor. A g-factor anomaly on the neck orbit in gold is discussed. © 1989 The American Physical Society.},

In this study the authors made a theoretical investigation of the EES of aluminium in the range of existence of the solid phase (0 K less than T less than 900 K).},
