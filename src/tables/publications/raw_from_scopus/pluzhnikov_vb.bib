abstract={The de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) effect in the anti-ferromagnetic FeGe 2 compound is studied experimen-tally. A sharp suppression of amplitude for the first harmonic of the dHvA oscillations is observed for a number of orbits on the Fermi surface of FeGe2. It is found that the conditions of the dHvA amplitude sup-pression ("spin-splitting zero") are changed for FeGe2 doped with cobalt. To analyse the experimental data we proposed a method of comprehensive calculation of conduction electron g-factors in itinerant antiferro-magnetic systems, which is based on the calculations of spin-polarized electronic structure, taking into ac-count the spin-orbit interaction, and estimated the fac-tor of exchange enhancement of spin paramagnetism in FeGe2.},

abstract={De Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) effect measurements were performed on GdB 4 single crystal (R 300 K/R 4.2K ≈ 12) in AFM state from 1.5 to 4.2 K in magnetic fields up to 14 T. 12 main branches of the oscillations were observed in the frequency range (0.1 ÷ 28) × 10 2 T. The angular dependence of the dHvA spectrum suggests a strongly anisotropic Fermi surface. Corresponding cyclotron masses m c * are light, ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 m0. We studied additionally the magnetization of GdB 4, linear and volume magnetostriction, and magnetoresistance of GdB 4 in comparison with the same properties of TmB 4 single crystal above 1.5 K in the field of 0 ÷ 14 T. At 4.2 K and H ∥ 〈110〈 collinear to the GdB 4 easy magnetization axis the volume magnetostriction revealed the lattice contraction with the field rise excluding the range of H ≈ (11 ÷ 13) T, where the lattice expansion is accompanied by a sharp magnetization increase due to the destruction of its non-collinear magnetic structure. The magnetostricive behavior in GdB 4 and TmB 4 is different due to the CEF effect. © 2012 EDP Sciences, Società Italiana di Fisica, Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The heat capacity (Cp) and dilatation (α) of YB 12 and LuB12 are studied. Cp of the zone-melted YB12 tricrystal is measured in the range 2.5-70 K, of the zone-melted LuB12 single crystal in the range 0.6-70 K, and of the LuB12 powder sample in the range 4.3-300 K; α of the zone-melted YB12 tricrystal and LuB12 single crystals is measured in the range 5-200 K. At low temperatures a negative thermal expansion (NTE) is revealed for both compounds: for YB12 at 50-70 K, for LuB12 at 10-20 K and 60-130 K. Their high-temperature NTE is a consequence of nearly non-interacting freely oscillating metal ions (Einstein oscillators) in cavities of a simple cubic rigid Debye lattice formed by B 12 cage units. The Einstein temperatures are ∼254 and ∼164 K, and the Debye temperatures are ∼1040 K and ∼1190 K for YB12 and LuB12 respectively. The LuB12 low-temperature NTE is connected with an induced low-energy defect mode. The YB12 superconducting transition has not been detected up to 2.5 K. © 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

YB12 and LuB 12 are diamagnetics whereas the other dodecaborides are ordered antiferromagnetically. The amplitude of the heat capacity discontinuity at the Néel temperature and the shape of the heat capacity variation in the critical region for all these antiferromagnetics are characteristics for amplitude-modulated magnetic structures. In the ordered state TbB12 reveals two first-order phase transitions, most likely due to magnetic structure changes. The heat capacity of ErB12 just below the Néel point shows an anomaly of unclear origin. From the Schottky contribution to the heat capacity we have determined crystal field parameters. They are completely different than that is estimated from Point Charge Model. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Additionally, for the doped layer of Al0.32Ga0.68As, the free-electron concentration was changed in situ by illumination and emptying the metastable DX centers. These results were compared with those for GaAs bulk crystals examined using dylatometry. It was confirmed that n-type doping increases thermal expansion at temperatures higher than about 120 K. At lower temperatures, a phenomenon of the negative thermal expansion becomes much more pronounced for the doped GaAs sample. © 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

Two types of AF spiral structure of different symmetry are found. The transverse AF spiral phase exists in comparatively small magnetic fields, H<HpHe(aoqc)2 (He is the exchange field, qc the spiral wave vector, and ao the lattice constant), while the longitudinal AF spiral phase exists in stronger magnetic fields up to HtHeaoqc. The phase transition between these two AF spiral structures in the field-temperature phase diagram is first order. The temperature dependence of the wave vector of the spiral structure in the absence of magnetic field is also determined, and the results of magnetostriction experiments are explained. © 1989 The American Physical Society.},

The shape magnetostriction remained constant and roughly equal to the large value observed in Pd.
