abstract={The piezomagnetoelectric effect is considered to be the appearance of a piezoelectric response caused by a magnetic field in magnetically ordered media. The possibility of its existence in antiferromagnets was predicted in the 1960's; however, attempts at its experimental detection were unsuccessful.

abstract={The influence of the external magnetic field on the Jahn-Teller phase transition at Tc ≈ 14 K is studied in the single crystal KDy(MoO4)2. At temperatures below Tc the essential change of the velocity and attenuation of acoustic modes of the crystal is discovered in the magnetic field, oriented along the [110] direction. Such a behavior of elastic characteristics is determined by the destruction of the antiferrodistorsive ordering, connected, in turn, with the ordering of the quadrupole orbital moments, charecteristic for the "orbital nematic". The low temperature part of the H-T phase diagram for this direction of the field is restored. It is disco-vered that the critical temperature dependence on the field is nonmonotonic, i.e., the phase transition has the re-entrant character. Theoretical description of the observed anomalies of the temperature and magnetic field behavior of the acoustic characteristics is given.},

abstract={The piezomagnetic response of single crystal CoF<inf>2</inf> is studied using acoustic oscillations at frequencies of ~55 MHz. Without an external magnetic field the results reproduce the data from direct static measurements. A magnetic field opens up an additional piezomagnetic response channel with an amplitude that is linear in the field strength. The efficiencies of the two channels become equal in the antiferromagnetic state for H ~ 3 T. Above the Neel temperature the mechanism for the first channel ceases to operate, while the piezomagnetic response associated with the new channel falls off approximately exponentially. The sound speeds for the different crystallographic directions are measured and the components of the elastic modulus tensor are calculated. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract={The acoustic-electric transformation in high-quality FeSe single crystals is studied. In zero magnetic field we observe an abnormally strong electromagnetic radiation induced by a transverse elastic wave. Usually a radiation of such intensity and polarization is observed only in metals subjected to a high magnetic field (the radiation is caused by the Hall current). We argue that in FeSe in zero magnetic field it is caused by the piezomagnetic effect which is most probably of dynamical origin. We find that the piezomagnetism survives under the transition from the normal to superconducting state. In the superconducting state the electromagnetic signal decreases with decreasing temperature that is connected with the change in the London penetration depth. © Copyright EPLA, 2013.},

abstract={The behavior of the elastic moduli and sound absorption in a terbium orthoborate single crystal at low temperatures is studied. The components of the tensor of the elastic moduli of this system are determined. A structural phase transition and a transition of the magnetic subsystem into an antiferromagnetically ordered state appear in the temperature dependences of the sound velocities and absorption. The magnetic field dependences of the velocities of transverse sound exhibit singularities in the form of jumps at a magnetic field equal to the field of the spin-flop transition of the antiferromagnetic subsystem. Theoretical analysis shows that the observed behavior of the acoustic characteristics are associated not with the rare-earth subsystem of ferroborate but rather with the renormalization of the exchange interaction between iron ions as a result of the magnetoelastic coupling. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

The magnetic-field influence on sound properties found in this study presents some interesting features of the interplay between the elastic and magnetic properties of these compounds. It is shown that the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition in the sample studied is first order, but can become second order under the influence of applied magnetic field. © 2006 The American Physical Society.},
