abstract={An anion-radical salt (ARS) [Co(bipy)3](TCNQ)4·H2O was synthesized and its crystal structure was resolved. The experimental investigation of [Co(bipy)3](TCNQ)4·H2O and two ARS with similar crystal structure [Zn(bipy)3](TCNQ)4·H2O and [Ni(bipy)3](TCNQ)4·(CH3)2CO by the measurement of the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility at temperature from 1.8 K to 300 K, the field dependence of magnetization up to 7 T at different temperatures and EPR spectra in temperature range from 2 K to 300 K was performed. [Zn(bipy)3](TCNQ)4·H2O was used to estimate the contribution of the TCNQ radicals to the magnetic moment. In result, the compound [Co(bipy)3](TCNQ)4·H2O was characterized by the presence of Co2+ ions in spin-admixed state and low-temperature susceptibility, magnetization and specific heat of [Ni(bipy)3](TCNQ)4·(CH3)2CO was shown to be dominated by the contribution of single-ion anisotropy of Ni2+ ions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Magnetic behavior of CoII(n)AlIII layered double hydroxides (LDHs) (n=Co/Al=2 and 3) intercalated with nitrate was studied as a function of temperature. Both LDH compounds are paramagnetic above about 8K. A rapid increase of their magnetic moments occurs below this temperature until the moments reach the maximum values at Tmax of 4.0K and 3.2K for Co(2)Al-NO3 and Co(3)Al-NO3, respectively. Below Tmax, the zero-field-cooled and the field-cooled static magnetization curves are strongly different. Along with this low-temperature phenomena, Co(2)Al-NO3 and Co(3)Al-NO3 demonstrate anomalous behavior of their temperature dependence magnetic susceptibility in a highertemperature range: between 75 and 175K, both the paramagnetic Curie temperature and the effective magnetic moment change in a non-monotonous way. Possible structural reasons of the observed magnetic behavior of the CoII(n)AlIII LDHs are discussed.},

abstract={Magnetic and thermodynamic properties of polycrystalline multiferroic Bi0.65La0.35Fe0.5Sc0.5O3 synthesized under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions are reported. Magnetic properties were studied using a SQUID magnetometer technique over the temperature range of 5−300 K in magnetic fields up to H=10 kOe. The field dependent magnetization M(H) was measured in magnetic fields up to 50 kOe at different temperatures up to 230 K after zero-field cooling procedure. A long-range magnetic ordering of the AFM type with a weak FM contribution occurs below the Néel temperature TN ~237 K. Magnetic hysteresis loops taken below TN show a huge coercive field up to Hc ~10 kOe. A strong effect of magnetic field on the magnetic properties of the compound has been found. Derivative of the initial magnetization curves demonstrates a temperature-dependent anomaly in fields of H=15−25 kOe. Besides, an anomaly of the temperature dependent zero-field cooled magnetization measured in magnetic fields of 6−7 kOe has been found. Origin of both anomalies is associated with inhomogeneous magnetic state of the compound. The heat capacity has been measured from 2 K up to room temperature and a significant contribution from the magnon excitations at low temperatures has been detected. From the low-temperature heat capacity, an anisotropy gap of the magnon modes of the order 3.7 meV and Debye temperature TD=189 K have been determined. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A 20% substitution of Bi with La in the perovskite Bi1-xLaxFe0.5Sc0.5O3 system obtained under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions has been found to induce an incommensurately modulated structural phase. The room-temperature x-ray and neutron powder diffraction patterns of this phase were successfully refined using the Imma(0,0,γ)s00 superspace group (γ=0.534(3)) with the modulation applied to Bi/La and oxygen displacements. The modulated structure is closely related to the prototype antiferroelectric structure of PbZrO3 which can be considered as the lock-in variant of the latter with γ=0.5. Below TN∼220 K, the neutron diffraction data provide evidence for a long-range G-type antiferromagnetic ordering commensurate with the average Imma structure. Based on a general symmetry consideration, we show that the direction of the spins is controlled by the antisymmetric exchange imposed by the two primary structural distortions, namely oxygen octahedral tilting and incommensurate atomic displacements. The tilting is responsible for the onset of a weak ferromagnetism, observed in magnetization measurements, whereas the incommensurate displacive mode is dictated by the symmetry to couple a spin-density wave. The obtained results demonstrate that antisymmetric exchange is the dominant anisotropic interaction in Fe3+-based distorted perovskites with a nearly quenched orbital degree of freedom. © 2015 American Physical Society.},

abstract={Neutron powder diffraction measurements on the 35 % La-substituted Bi1-xLaxFe0.5Sc0.5O3 composition revealed that the samples obtained under high-pressure (6 GPa) and higherature (1500 K) conditions crystalize into a distorted perovskite structure with the orthorhombic Pnma symmetry and the unit cell parameters: ao = 5.6745(2) Å, bo = 7.9834(3) Å and co = 5.6310(2) Å. A long-range magnetic ordering takes place below 220 K and implies a G-type magnetic structure with the moments 4.10(4)μB per Fe aligned predominately along the orthorhombic c-axis. The space group representation theory using the orthorhombic symmetry yields four bi-linear coupling schemes for the magnetic order parameters imposed by antisymmetric exchange interactions. The couplings are analysed based on symmetry adapted distortion modes defined in respect of the undistorted cubic perovskite structure. The approach allows a quantitative estimation of the coupling strength. It is shown that the experimentally found spin configuration combines the magnetic order parameters coupled by the atomic displacement modes with the largest amplitudes. The results indicate that the antisymmetric exchange is the dominant anisotropic term which fully controls the direction of the Fe3+ spins in the distorted perovskite lattice. © 2015 by De Gruyter.},

abstract={Exchange bias phenomenon, evident of antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic phase segregation state, has been observed in (Nd1-xYx)2/3Ca1/3MnO3 (x = 0, 0.1) compounds at low temperatures. A contribution to the total magnetization of the compounds due to the ferromagnetic phase has been evaluated. It has been found that yttrium doping leads to the growth of the ferromagnetic phase fraction. The ferromagnetic phase in the doped compound has a lower coercivity Hc and more rectangular form of the hysteresis loop. The values of the exchange bias field HEB and coercivity are found to be strongly dependent on the cooling magnetic field Hcool. In sufficiently high magnetic fields, Hcool &gt; 5 kOe, HEB in the doped compound is about twice as low as in the parent compound. This difference is attributed to a lower exchange interaction and higher saturation magnetization of the ferromagnetic phase in (Nd0.9Y0.1)2/3Ca1/3MnO3. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract={Exchange bias phenomenon evident of antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic phase segregated state has been observed in (Nd1-xYx)2/3Ca1/3MnO3 (x = 0; 0.1) compounds at low temperatures. A contribution to the total magnetization of the compounds due to the ferromagnetic phase has been evaluated. It has been found that yttrium doping leads to the growth of the ferromagnetic phase fraction. The ferromagnetic phase in the doped compound has a lower coercivity Hc and more rectangular form of the hysteresis loop. The values of the exchange bias field HEB and coercivity are found to be strongly dependent on the cooling magnetic field Hcool. In sufficiently high magnetic fields, Hcool &gt; 5 kOe, the HEB value is approximately twice in the doped compound than in the parent compound. This difference is attributed to the lower exchange interaction and the higher saturation magnetization of the ferromagnetic phase in (Nd0.9Y0.1)2/3Ca1/3MnO3.},

abstract={The magnetic properties of Fe1+yTe single crystals (y≃ 0.10.18) were studied at temperatures 4.2300K. At an ambient pressure, with decreasing temperature a drastic drop in χ(T) was confirmed at T≃ 6065K, which appears to be closely related to the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering. It is found that the magnitudes of the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility Δχ in the AFM phase are close in the studied samples, whereas the sign of the anisotropy apparently depends on the small variations of the excess iron y in Fe1+yTe samples. The performed DFT calculations of the electronic structure and magnetic properties for the stoichiometric FeTe compound indicate the presence of frustrated AFM ground states. There are very close energies and magnetic moments for the double stripe configurations, with the AFM axes oriented either on the basal plane or along the [0 0 1] direction. Presumably, both these configurations can be realized in Fe1+yTe single crystals, depending on the variations of the excess iron. This can provide different signs of magnetic anisotropy in the AFM phase, presently observed in the Fe1+yTe samples. For these types of AFM configuration, the calculations for the FeTe values of Δχ are consistent with our experimental data. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The electronic energy structures and magnetic properties of layered superconductors RNi2B2C, RFe4Al8, and FeSe are systematically studied, by using the density functional theory (DFT). The calculations allowed us to reveal a number of features of the electronic structure, which can cause the manifestation of peculiar structural, magnetic and superconducting properties of these systems. It is demonstrated that the Fermi energy EF is located close to the pronounced peaks of the electronic density of states (DOS). The main contribution to DOS at the Fermi level arises from 3d-electrons. The calculations of the pressure-dependent electronic structure and the magnetic susceptibility in the normal state indicate that the novel superconductors are very close to a magnetic instability with dominating spin paramagnetism. It is shown that experimental data on the pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature in FeSe correlate qualitatively with the calculated behavior of DOS at EF as a function of the pressure. © G.E.

abstract={The magnetic properties of nitrogen-doped multi-walled carbon nanotubes (N-MWCNTs) were studied in the temperature and magnetic field range of (4.2-290) K and (0.05-30) kOe, respectively. Also magnetic properties of the reference MWCNTs without nitrogen doping were investigated on the same footing for comparison. The presence of iron-based particles inside N-MWCNTs was detected. The low temperature SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) magnetization measurements were supplemented with thermogravimetric analysis. The magnetic characterization provided the saturation magnetic moment M S and residual magnetization MR of N-MWCNTs to be, respectively, 4.5 emu/g and 0.9 emu/g, whereas for the reference MWCNTs the corresponding parameters are found to be about twice higher. The coercive field value amounts to 800 Oe for both systems at low temperatures, then decreasing to about 450 Oe at 200 K. Copyright © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

abstract={A detailed magnetization study for the novel FeSe superconductor is carried out to investigate the behavior of the intrinsic magnetic susceptibility χ in the normal state with temperature and under hydrostatic pressure. The temperature dependences of χ and its anisotropy Δχ = χ- χ are measured for FeSe single crystals in the temperature range 4.2-300 K, and a substantial growth of susceptibility with temperature is revealed. The observed anisotropy Δχ is very large and comparable to the averaged susceptibility at low temperatures. For a polycrystalline sample of FeSe, the significant pressure effect on χ is determined to be essentially dependent on temperature. Ab initio calculations of the pressure-dependent electronic structure and magnetic susceptibility indicate that FeSe is close to magnetic instability, with dominating enhanced spin paramagnetism. The calculated paramagnetic susceptibility exhibits a strong dependence on the unit cell volume and especially on the height Z of chalcogen species from the Fe plane. The change of Z under pressure determines a large positive pressure effect on χ, which is observed at low temperatures. It is shown that the literature experimental data on the strong and nonmonotonic pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature in FeSe correlate qualitatively with the calculated behavior of the density of electronic states at the Fermi level. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The magnetization of FeSe1-xTex (x∼0, 0.5, and 1.0) compounds has been studied in magnetic fields up to 50kOe and at temperatures of 2-300K. The superconducting transition was observed at Tc∼8K and 13.6-14.2K in FeSe0.963 and FeSe0.5Te0.5, respectively. For most of the samples, nonlinearity of the magnetization curves in the normal state gives evidence of a common, substantial presence of ferromagnetic impurities in these compounds.

The sensitivity of high-resolution magnetic measurements carried out at low temperatures in such high fields is limited inevitably by magnetic and electric properties of the structural Dewar materials involved. Magnetic properties of various G-FRP Dewar-purpose materials are explored with a χ-meter furnished with a RF SQUID magnetometer. The Dewar materials and multilayer insulation effects contributing to the magnetic response signal are analyzed. It has also been discovered that field noise caused by the magnetization of the Dewar materials can be suppressed substantially by using special glass-epoxy technologies. The liquid helium evaporation rate is 3.8 l/day while the hold time is 27 h, the influencing factors are discussed. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The temperature dependencies of the magnetic susceptibility χ and its anisotropy Δ χ = χ{norm of matrix} - χ⊥ were measured for the hexagonal single crystalline TB2 compounds (T = Sc, Ti, Zr, Hf, V and Cr) in the temperature range 4.2-300 K. It was found that Δ χ varies strongly and nonmonotonously with the filling of the hybridized d-band, being almost temperature independent and the largest for the diborides of group 4 metals. Ab initio calculations of the electronic structure and susceptibility of the diborides provide evidence that magnetic anisotropy originates from competing Van Vleck paramagnetism and the orbital diamagnetism of conduction electrons. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Magnetic susceptibility χ of the itinerant antiferromagnet CrB 2 with TN ≃ 87 K was studied as a function of the hydrostatic pressure up to 2 kbar at fixed temperatures 78 and 300 K. The pressure effect on % is found to be negative in sign and weakly dependent on the magnetic state of the compound. In addition, the measured pressure dependence of the Néel temperature, dTN/dP = (0.1 ± 0.1) K/kbar, is roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding value for the pure chromium. The main contributions to x and their volume dependence are calculated ab initio within the local spin density approximation, and appeared to be in close agreement with the experimental data. © G.E.
